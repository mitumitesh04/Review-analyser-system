"Eva is on her to find a way to escape her abusive mother. When she meets a handsome stranger she doesn't know is the man she wants but the man she wants is strong and handsome. She is in love with him and will do anything to get her happily ever after.

"I have mixed emotions about this water filter system. I love how it is hung from a tree, and doesn't require pumping, but I did run into problems. I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days. My Base Camp Pro did come with the new and improved filer, but it couldn't handle what I needed it to. I love the idea, but was pretty disappointed.",0

"I had heard about 24 for a long time before ever seeing it.  I finally saw an episode a few weeks ago and thought it was quite good.  I ended up deciding to watch the first season.

It was certainly a highly entertaining show with no end to the action.  It contains murder, espionage, terrorism, traitors, kidnapping and a presidential assassination plot.  And that is all in one day.

The concept of the show is that each episode represents one hour of a day in real time.  The hero, federal anti terrorist agent Jack Bauer, encounters more action in two hours than any 50 average people do in their entire lives.

Although some of the events are certainly implausible in the time frames allotted, it is great entertainment.  Although I am not much of a TV watcher, I may just become one for this show.  I recommend it.",0
"I'm gonna give you the begginers outlook. I am only on day 3. I've done kick boxing and football so I'm not out of shape in the sense of not working out. I've had 3 knee surgeries and have fractured my ankle on my dominant (right) side. My dad is a pastor and a physical therapist healing hands I guess is why he toon that route. Anyway so I always got in homehelp but my body has gotten stiff over the years with cartledge and joint discomfort. We are talking complete subluxation (dislocation) of my knee caps from the sockets. So when I say I feel it in my quads, my hams, and my knees you better believe it. I don't know how well it's gonna play out but we will see. I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally.",0

My new kittens just love this toy and the dogs love it.  My 2 cats are pretty picky so I had to get a treat to get them to eat.  I will definitely buy again.  It's a little pricey for one cat but I don't have to worry about getting a treat as they love the flavor.  They are very picky so I like the taste of the treat.  I highly recommend it to any cat owner!Love this product.  It's very easy to use.  The smaller size fits my 60 pound dog perfectly.,1
"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.  My twenty year old bowls look brand new, even after 20 years of dishwasher abuse.  Whereas, my week old Indipets bowl is ALREADY scratched, falling apart and has pinched my finger so hard I still have a huge blood blister on my finger..",0

I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and I liked how the characters were developed. I was very impressed with the writing style and the characters. I would recommend it.I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story, the setting and the characters. I loved the way the story went on. I loved the characters, the story, the characters. I liked how the author took a story from the beginning to the end. I was a little confused at first, but I found it very entertaining.I'm a huge fan of the M/M genre.  I've read all of the 3 books in this series, and I have no problem recommending this series to anyone who is looking for a well written, well-paced, and well-written read.  I'm not going to say anything about the other books in this series, but I'll tell you this:  The last book was a bit of a shock, and I was very disappointed.  The other books were very good, but the story was lacking.  The main character, Daisy, is a very good-looking, sweet, determined, independent woman who had a hard time with her mother.  She's a sweetheart and a strong woman, but she's also a great friend.  She's also a beautiful, determined woman, but her heart is a bit broken.  She's trying to figure out how to get through this tough time, but she doesn't know what to do with it",1
"Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean. I was very very disappointed with this and even more with the companies lack of care in their product especially since I have owned older models for my cats in the past.",0

I use them to pour coffee beans or tea into bowls, it doesn't matter if you have a hot water pitcher or a hot water pitcher. I love the color, the color is not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but I really like the color of the bowls. I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease. I don't like that I have to push the handle to push out the water and it keeps the water from getting too hot.",1

"Dear Amazon Shopper,

The bottom line is this is an excellent product for the money.  I have one in my basement and the other in a garage.  The plastic is solid and strong and the coating is well made.  The only negative is that the mesh flap is a little short for the rubber hose.  I have to leave it in the car and it goes out of the way.

"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours.",0

"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you.",0

"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have.",0

"I usually wear a size 36 x 34 in all my jeans regardless of brand, so I ordered accordingly for the Silver Zac jeans. While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect.

"I have spent some amount of time playing with this walnut sized wonder. It is unexplainably addictive. Maybe it's the rather cool free apps that Ozobot has available for it. Maybe it's the color changing LED lights. Maybe it's the way you calibrate and tune it. The cool factor is just off the charts. I like the Ozobot Dance app the best. You place it on a space and with light flashes it programs this little beast. Then you press play and it signals the robo critter to do it's thing. It will go on top of your tablet or phone spinning, flashing and scooting along.

It must have taken quite some engineering to come up with this. To distill it for you it's sensors can detect lines and colors. It will change what it's doing, program itself and perform all of it's functions that way. Everything you need comes in the box. A couple of things to share with you: Instructions say you need to calibrate and tune it every time before you use it. But you can use it a few times without doing that, it seems if you only wait a few moments before uses it seems to hang on to it's setup. But if it's shut off for more than a few minutes you definitely need to go through the calibration/motors tune process (very easy).

It's not entirely perfect all the time during the tune process. Sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing, you just put it back in it's start position and usually it will be fine. Occasionally you will turn it off then repeat the tuning process. It's not a hassle. The whole experience is fun. Registration is free and gives you access to a lot of extras at no charge. I love this little nugget of technology. I've attached a picture with a sugar packet in comparison to give you an idea of it's true size. Sample for fair review.",0
"Great for a Marilyn fest. --- Nice to see Niagra ( neo film noir  in color ) for the first time --- Yeah I know like ""Leave her to heaven"" (also in color) they defy the labeling of Noir which means black in French. ---- Anyway you probably already know about all the individual films. This collection is just all the individual films bundled together.",0

First Stone novel. Good read. And it was not even a Parker novel. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Been a long time since I read a novel.,0

I really enjoyed thinking about what it would be like to be a father who is a father and son.  I had to watch it,1
"Excellent book! Being a parent is never an easy job, it comes with great responsibility on how we are going to deal with it. This book gives you insights and advises on how to face the challenges of being a parent and on how you are going to deal with your kid's personalities and characters in the right manner for them to become responsible of their own actions. Communication is a lot needed to understand each other, too, it is a give and take relationship. We should learn to listen and connect with them and even become a child if needed, that way we will be able to understand them. Be fun and creative! I highly recommend this book!",0
"Seriously, wow! I knew when I read the book that it was a book that would appeal to the older generation. I had to read it before I could even begin to consider it as a book that I would read again in a few",1
"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on. In a side-by-side comparison, the Apple screen cover has about twice the hold of this one, but this one protects the whole device and helps my hands grip what would otherwise be the difficult to handle smooth aluminum back.",0
"Both of my sons really enjoy this toy. The Cyberex is one of the best parts, but it is also really fun that you can lock a bad guy, or Batman, in to the stomach cage of Cyberex, which is also a great place to store Batman when you are done playing!
When Batman rides on his back, you can push on a button under Cyberex's tail that makes a top part pop up and you can push a button to get red discs to shoot out at the 'bad guys"" which is a big hit with both boys, and is easy enough for even my 3 yr old to work on his own. It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the ""go to"" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately! I like the bright blue coloring with the sliver and gold since it makes it look more robotic. Batman is the perfect size! It is a very fun Batman toy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a gift! We did receive it from Mattel as part of a Rate and Play review but it has been one of the most played with toys we have reviewed!",0
"Good rip fence. It actually comes with three thumbscrews. The new model Milwaukee saw uses one thumbscrew, & the old model uses two, so all three are included. I have owned both models, and the one with two thumbscrews works better. The new model I have now has the one thumbscrew that goes in at an angle & tends to turn the rip fence at an angle when tightened. It still works good, the rip fence is great, but the saw itself could have been designed better.",0
"I have seven cats, no dogs. I sometimes get these purebites that are marketed to dogs because the bags are so much bigger. The pieces in the ""dog"" ones are bigger & sometimes harder than the ones for cats. I do  have to break up the big pieces and eliminate the really hard ones, but it is such a good value that it seems worth the extra work.

edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats. Probably just fine for most dogs since they love chewing on even harder things like bones... but I think I will stick to the cat version for my cats in the future.",0
"Skeletons at the Feast is a book I want to read again. This is a book that is a keeper. The people, the places, the words, the stories, the stories of the people and the people of the land are one thing. But it is also a book that is a great read. I will be reading the next one in the series. I love this book. I can't wait to read the next one. I loved this book. It was very well written and I was so excited to get to the end. I just couldn't get into it and am glad I did. I love the way the author takes the time to explain the book and the characters, the stories and the twists and turns. I also like the way the author describes the people, the language, the people of the book. I especially loved the way she describes the people of the book. It was very easy to relate to as a reader. I also liked the way the author describes the characters and the scenes. I am always interested in this author and this book is a keeper. I would have liked this book more if it had more of a mystery element to it. It was a bit of a mystery and not very exciting, but it was good enough.",1
Another great story in the series. The characters are well developed and the story is well told. The story is well written and the characters are well developed.I love this book.  The characters are well developed and the story is well written.  This book is a great series,1
A refreshing read.  At first I thought the writing was good but as the story progressed I realized the author had not had a grasp of how to develop the characters.  The writing was very difficult to follow and the dialogue was quite a bit choppy.  The story was short and the story was fast paced but I found it difficult to keep reading the story.  I really enjoyed this series.This book was very good. I love the characters. I loved the way the story went about getting to know them. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great romance.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more from this author.This was a very good book.

"I love how it comes with the handle and wheels to cart around behind my son.  The only thing that I did not like was that it comes apart very easily and my 2 year old is constantly pulling the front and back apart.  But it is durable, and he has yet to break it.
For the price it is a great deal if you have a little boy who loves his cars and trucks like mine.",0
"I sue these dogs beds as a liner for my dog's cots.  This is what I was looking for to place on top of the dog cots so they are not laying on the rougher mesh surface of the cot.  They fit the large cots well.  They are a too thin to use alone as a dog bed.  They fit well in a large wire kennel but they are still a little to thin for comfort for my older dogs.  I have not washed them but I tumble them in the dryer to freshen, fluff and remove dog hair.",0

"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted. Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it.",0
It's ok. I get it's a classic but still it's just an ok movie.,0

"This is an especially good young person's movie. It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of ""Short Circuit,"" what it means to be alive. Note Ren Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, ""Cogito, ergo sum."" (I think, therefore I am.)

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of ""Short Circuit"" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low.",0

This was my first time reading this author and I was not disappointed. She had great dialogue and chemistry between Jaro and Roslyn and managed to create a delightfully eccentric world for them to get to know one another in. There were plenty moments where I laughed out loud and while the suspense elements of Jaro's witness protection program were slightly unbelievable it definitely did not detract from the story. My one personal request would be for a little more steamy scenes between Jaro and Roslyn but the book definitely didn't feel like it was missing anything. I would for sure reccommend this book and you really can't beat the price.,0

"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

Two items I would like to see the vendor improve would be including felt pads underneath so it doesn't scratch my wood laminate floor (I will add some felt furniture pads underneath).  Second, increasing the post diameter at least one inch. Currently it's under three inches and a little narrow.",0

"Shop Fox D3030 16-Inch Full Ext Drawer Slide 100-Pound Capacity Side Mount, Pair Review

I bought 2 pair of the Shop Fox slides to use for a custom closet build. They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price.",0

"I confess I'm an early adopter and the lure of the video for Kevo where doors open at a touch was too much to resist.

The lock is a total failure. The iPhone has to have the app open or it doesn't work, the lock locks arbitrarily, often after I use the key to get in and it locks as I'm closing it (sending the bolt into the doorframe)
When it does work the mechanism is so slow that I would never want to be trying to get into the house in a panic situation.
I have calibrated and re-calibrated,  all to no avail.
I hear Schlage's bluetooth lock is better, but I probably won't invest in that one either now.

The silver bracelet has a little  solid heart dangle and the bracelet lays pretty around the ankle. Just Love them - wearing it makes me feel good!
I received the bracelet earlier than expected from the seller which I appreciated because I wanted it as soon as I saw it on line!  The silver bracelet came with it's own little silver  draw string organza bag to keep it in.  Very sweet and pretty way to keep it nice and safely stored.

"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives. Bicycles, lawn mowers, BBQ, etc... works great and much more economical than the pulley systems being sold today.",0

"I've had one of these for years and I want to get at least one more.  I haven't been able to find them in home improvement stores lately.  You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface.  There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast.  When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.  And you can make additional bolts to mount the same clamp at different places simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder.  It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.  And if you know the brand you know their tools are well made - American made by the way.",0

"This review is for a specific set of pieces, which I will not be buying again.  The other two pieces are for the most part interchangeable, but if you are a fan of metal, this is a great piece.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so heavy, the frame is a bit over-sized, and the hinges are rather poor.  This is not a big deal for me, but it is a very small piece of furniture.  I would recommend this item.Perfect for my espresso maker.  Works great.These are super cute and the colors are great.  I love the way they are made.  I bought these for my son to use to keep them in his room for his mom's bathroom.  He loves them!  I have used them for a while now and they look very good.  They are very well made and have a great design.  I would definitely recommend these for anyone who loves to make espresso and has a lot of time to get started.  I have tried everything from instant coffee to espresso makers, and these are the best.  They are not heavy duty, but they are sturdy and have good construction.  I would definitely buy again.

"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

The material is very durable and I would recommend it for dogs with heavy hands.Great for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.

One thing that I would like to note is that the description for this collar is very misleading.  There are a few things I can tell you about the collar, but I will be giving it a 5.  The description says that it is ""Upper-collar, upper-collar, lower-collar, dog",1

However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish.",0

"My dog has arthritis and Cushing disease, so she takes several medications three times each day.  Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose.",0

Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build. But the coolest part about it which I discovered later is that standard steam table pans fit perfectly in the cooler. I use a 1/3 X 6'' deep pan to keep meat and cheese out of the ice. The lip of the pan rests in a groove near the top of the cooler and keeps the pan above the ice. It slides easily side to side to access below it without removing the pan. Very slick. 1/2 pans would work well too. The pans come in 2'' 4'' & 6'' depths. I have the 35qt. But the pans should work in the 45 & 65qt. since they all seem to have the same dimension from front to rear. See my user photo. Note the weight of this cooler. It is not a trivia item. I'm glad I got the '' small one''. It is bigger than it looks in the photos.,0

The wraith took me a bit to understand exactly how that plays out to be the enemy. The magic system could have been explained more. I'm starting The Mirror King right away so no big cliffhanger wait for me to find out what happens.",0

"I ordered the lobster costume and it arrived with a very small opening.  The dimensions were just right.  The costume is very tall and the size is perfect for a small dog.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.I was skeptical about the price for this product but I found it a bit too expensive. I did get a medium and a large but the medium was great. I just wish it came in a different color for my dog because it is hard to see her from the side of the house. I would have been happy with the medium. I was just too big for my dog and the size is too small for my dog. I have a 14 lb dog and I found this size and it was perfect. I can see why the price was a bit high but I was able to find it at a very good price. I will never buy this again.Very cute, very well made and really works.  I would buy again if I were able to.

"Hell Town, 1937 film

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.

Did you learn a lesson about gambling? This was adopted from a Zane Grey novel ""Born to the West"". Professional gamblers know all kind of tricks.",0

Yes it takes some effort to ""load"" the leather, but if you look on youtube you'll find all kinds of tricks to make that work.  This strop should cost about $25.

First Impression: Well-written, engaging, expertly executed, and FUN, a book after my heart. Chloe is a software analyst who works from home and only allows herself to truly experience lifeand sexwhen she goes to comic conventions, dressed in sexy cosplay costumes that give her the carefree confidence she lacks in her day to day life. She likes the role play a lot because she feels brave in the costumes, more in control of herself and her needs. It's at one of the conventions she goes to that she meets Grant Osprey and though they didn't share their real names, they did share a night together. A night Grant would like to repeat, despite the fact that his convention lover turns out to be his friend and business partner's little sister. Oops. I freaking loved this book! It's a quick, fast-paced read that immediately caught my attention and held me captive throughout my reading. Maybe it's the author's easy, seemingly effortless writing style, or maybe it's my own experiences with going to comic conventions and being amazed by all the costumes--a few of which my own niece has designed and worn, but I instantly fell in love with Chloe and Grant's story because I could relate to them on a very real scale. Which made for such a fun and enjoyable read for me. If you love stories of forbidden love with fun, sexy role play between two well-drawn characters who will positively mesmerize you, Playing For Her Heart by Megan Erickson is an excellent read by an extremely talented author.",0

"This review is specifically about the leather-bound Easton Press edition, for those who are contemplating buying this version.  It really is a beautiful looking book.  It is bound in rust-brown full leather, with orange and metallic gold ornamentation on the front cover and spine, with all page edges gilt.  (On the scan I have entered onto Amazon, the gold stamping looks very dull; it's difficult to scan reflective metallic colours.  The appearance of the book when seen in person is much more brilliant that the photo suggests.)

This edition measures six-and-a-half by nine inches in size, is 204 pages in length, and contains numerous black-and-white line drawings by Kay Nielsen.  It also contains full-colour plates by the artist---HOWEVER---here is the problem.  There were 25 paintings done for the original edition of this book, and the Easton Press edition only contains eight of them.  I cannot imagine why on earth this ""luxury"" edition of the book doesn't contain all of the colour plates; I'm totally baffled by the omission of nearly two-thirds of the artwork.  If not for that fact, this really would be the perfect edition of the book to own.  But as it is, I don't know that this Easton edition is worth the price.",0

Guy Ritchie takes you on a wild ride through the madness and mayhem that begins with the a shady real estate deal and never lets up.

Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies.",0

It is a difficult book to read, not in readability terms but in that it really makes you think about what is going on.
This book is not for the faint-hearted, as there are some themes that some will likely find uncomfortable.  However, if you want to read something different and challenging, this is your book.",0

"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.",0

"I liked this story, not exactly sure why this one took me so much longer to read than the other Sapphire Falls books. It took me almost a month to read. Maybe it's because Lauren was trying so hard not to like a town I loved? All in all the book was good, I still can't get over how long it took me to read.",0
"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months.",0

"I'm not the best at doing any kind of organized crafts with my children. My style is more along the lines of giving them art supplies and letting them create what they want, and honestly, that's what I'll always prefer for them. They really enjoy projects that have a somewhat defined end result sometimes, though, and so it's kits like this that come to my rescue. Thankfully, they still get to be a bit creative with these projects, and while end results might look similar for many children, they probably won't look just alike.

There are 16 projects within this box, with lots and lots of little pieces. There are only instructions for 5 of the projects, but really, with those instructions, you can easily figure out the rest of them. I would have preferred for each of the projects to have been individually packaged to make things easier. I have had kits like that, and they make things a breeze for this disorganized mama. This kit does need a bit more organization on my part, but it's really not that bad. The supplies are all separated into different bags, and there are even extra bags for me to divide out some of the supplies. I could turn my children loose with everything and see what they come up with, but I prefer separating each project(at least for the most part), so that my children can choose which one they want to do, and not worry about running out of supplies before all the project are finished. Between my 3 children, I'll get 5 rainy days out of this box, with one extra. (I can't beat that!) ;) Plus, the included finger crayons can be used after all the projects are finished.

This is a really nice box of crafts. Especially if you're like me, and don't do so well with organized crafts, this is an excellent way to give your children some fun with crafts.",0

Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. It is sadly just not suited for my body. On me - it lets all of the wrong things hang out (I'll upload a photo to show what I mean). Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit.

We are impressed with the quality of the jacket and how it fits.  It is really stretchy fabric so it fits snug to the body.  Overall since it is black it has a slimming effect or look.  It has a wide collar that can be folded back or buttoned up around your neck.  The sleeve and body length is just right and overall the fits my wife's body style well.  I would recommend the jacket.

If you want to read a romance story that does not rely on hard core sex scenes then you will enjoy this book..I enjoyed getting to know the characters in the book.  I fell in love with Carson the sweet little boy that Cynthia is taking care of while his parents are on a over due honeymoon.  I am hoping that Cynthia's sister Gail gets her story told .

"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure.",0

I bought this book because I heard that it inspired George Romero to create Night of the Living Dead.  The main story is amazing.

I purchased the exact item from Walmart for $59.99.
The sound is okay if you use an equalizer to balance things out. Small speakers *always* mean small sound.
The four corner speakers are 8 Watts each. Don't let the ""150W"" fool you. The center speaker's qualitty reminds me of a pocket radio's speaker. It's very mid-range only and there's almost no tonal quality to voices.
The cables should be longer. I'm going to have to make extensions for my application. That's not hard since the speakers, except for the front right, are RCA. I believe a 9-pin D-SUB extension cable will work for the front right speaker but I'm not sure yet.
I would much rather have the volume control separate instead of on one of the speakers as my right speaker is four feet away.",0

"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy.
The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces.
Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there.
These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.

I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?

But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far.
I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck.",0

"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.

Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.

"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?

"In 1988, British ITV did a documentary called ""The Burgh"" on the Burgh, the infamous British army camp in Iraq. The Burgh is the most infamous camp in the world today. The Burgh is in fact a fictional story about the soldiers and their families. The documentary also includes a behind the scenes look at the Burgh and how the Army came to be involved in it.

The documentary also includes a brief interview with British author and critic Michael Wilbon. Wilbon talks about his work on the Burgh, and how he created the Burgh.

The documentary also includes a short documentary that covers some of the things that went into making the film, and some of the questions that Wilbon has raised in the documentary.

The documentary also includes a brief interview with British film director Alan Richardson, who was also a director of ""The Burgh"". Richardson talks about the reasons that the Burgh was created, and the reasons why they were chosen to make it.

The documentary also includes a trailer for the documentary, which you can see in the trailer. This documentary is not for the faint of heart, as it is very long, and it covers a lot of things that have been said about the Burgh.

"I'm a 6'2 240 pound amateur bodybuilder. I ordered this for an alternative cardio method living here in South Florida and as a fishing platform. To be clear I use this solo as the single seater was too small and I exceed the weight limit.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

Only complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull.",0

The chemistry from the get go was unmistakable. Lorelei was stuck in a self imposed rut raising her daughter and Jack was in a self imposed denial because of what his mom did to him. The push and pull was fantastic until the walls came crumbling down. From the beginning Lorelei put Jack in his place only problem was Jack opened his mouth before he thought which hurt her. Jack didn't realize he did because Lorelei was a first for him. As they continued to explore and push each other Jack is thrown into a situation way out of his control factor which helps open his eyes for a little while anyway. He refuses to admit anything until he thinks he might loose her for good. Being a strong independent woman makes her show who is boss. I found it hard to put this down. I wanted to see how Lorelei was going to put Jack on his toes and how Jack was going to stick his foot in his mouth.

I felt all the emotions Madison felt as she tried to fit in at school.
Not fitting in because of coming from a very strict pastor's family, having to dress in very conservative styles, and on top of that seeing and smelling strange things connected to others around her, are just a few of her problems.
What makes this book different is the interesting thinking of a spiritual realm that I believe is all around us and the battles that take place.

My 76lb pup loves this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. There's a hole in the bottom that is the plastic part. The toy is made of plastic and it's hard to put together. There are two pieces of plastic in the center that are a bit difficult to put together. I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing issue or just a design issue.,1

"My 5 dogs and 3 puppies all would not eat this & the usually love everything!! My daughter' dog got sick when she mixed it 50/50

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs! Also when I bought mine (it was on sale) I told my daughter to try it for her dog & she had the same problem, she was mixing it 50/50 with his regular food and where he normally ate 1 bowl a day, his bowl sat for 3 days and still had kibble in it and he also had an upset stomach from the little he ate and she was up cleaning his ""accidents"" and this dog that had never had one, had several in the middle  of the night !! If this was any good (*& my dogs liked it) I was going to order 20 bags at the sale price of 2/3 off! But now I know why it was so heavily discounted. The dogs won't eat it and it makes them sick! My dogs are Goldendoodles that my son raises hers is a small Havanese that can dehydrate quickly so 3 days of  severe GI problems  trying to introduce a new food was about the limit for her. He is back on his normal food and his tummy is doing better! I DO NOT recommend this food even if it was FREE!",0

I am not confident this will hold up to use but we will see.  Really hope it will be good!,0
"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

TIP: The floor does occasionally tip back, especially if the car seatback to which it is attached is tilted back slightly. The more upright you make the back of the car seat, the better the box hangs horizontally.",0

"This is a decent storage rack. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to store. I wish it had a plastic lid.  The plastic lid is a bit difficult to open.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size.  I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.  I'm very happy with the size of this, and I have a lot of compliments on it.  I have a nice collection of cookies, and I love how it's a little smaller than the cookie sheet.

"The doll is very well constructed with nice feeling ""skin"".  Some of them have a slippery feel but this has the nicer feeling skin.  The clothing is very pretty and my 5 year old granddaughter tester loved the way the skirt pops out and gives a different look.  You have to use your hands though to put it back down.

One problem I noticed is that the doll cannot stand up and there is no stand to put it on.  It is also a ""display"" sort of Barbie which has to continue wearing the same clothing so the absence of a stand is confusing.  For the 5 year old it is enough that she is pretty but older girls might want a way to display her.",0

"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Happy reading and good luck!",0

"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and it can be difficult to hold it in your hand.

Overall, I'm very happy with this holster.  I like that it's not too tight and that it's not too stiff.  I've only used it with a holster that was a little too tight and it still worked great.

"Not my usual fare, but this book kept me engaged. I will keep my eyes peeled for the next book from B. B. King. The characters were well developed and I enjoyed the story. It is a good read. I can't imagine what to say about this book. I'm not a fan of most of the books in the series. But I love this one. This book is a must read for any fan of all time. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will say that it is a well written book. You will not be disappointed. I have read all of the James Patterson novels and this is the first I have read. I couldn't put it down and I can't wait to see what happens next. This book is the best of the series. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Patterson novels. A perfect addition to any library. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and enjoy books that are not about animals.",1

"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.

The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details). A loving mother, continuing to act and work in films, Dyan Cannon has written a very good addition to the Hollywood biography canon.",0

"This movie is basically two people who are trying to make a living. One is a person who is self-conscious about the fact that his life is around him, and the other is a person who is afraid of him. Both of them have some kind of problem with the fact that they are a woman and have to do it because they can't work. I think that if you are a woman who has to deal with the fact that you have to work, then you will have to do something about it. You have to work, and you have to work, and you have to work. In the beginning, you are a woman and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work.

This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

If you are looking for something fancy, this probably isn't for you. If however you are looking for an inexpensive way to contain grease splatter, then you will be pleased with this product.",0

"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",0

"My dog has had skin bacteria issue on and off for a while because of his age and immunity.  I read the reviews on this item and had tried the Zymox brand for his ear yeast infections and this stuff performed pretty miraculously.

The shampoo is amazingly rich and thick.  It smells good and does a much better job than following up my dog's bath with a vinegar rinse which is what I was doing before to get rid of the skin issues.  However, my sensitive dog hated, really hated the vinegar rinse and it would stress him out so much that I had to find another solution.  I tried this and he was pleasantly surprised as was I.  This gets to the deep areas beneath the coat easily and doesn't just sit on the surface of the skin.  I followed the instructions about letting it sit for 3-5 minutes and I let it set for five and more.  The shampoo is easy to rinse out and really leaves his skin feeling soft.  After his bath, he does not show the normal irritation of moving from one position in the house to the next.  He seems more settled and not trying to escape the itch.  After his bath, I inspected the areas and they were almost as pink as the rest of his normal skin.

But don't be fooled!  Bacteria and fungus invasions are nothing to play around with.  I am giving him a bath every other day for three weeks and washing his bedding every single day and it is making a difference.  This shampoo is great and I have purchased the Zymox coat conditioner for after bath rinsing.  I will post more later as progress goes...",0

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive. I don't know what would get them more excited about this brand - sugar, probably, ha! I don't want them eating sugar except fruit, and this brand has some dried fruit.",0

Hint: these peewee pads come with 2 folds, one  in the front and one in the back.  Fold  front or back side under. Invariably, your pet will place its front paws on the pad and pee slightly behind it.  The folded-under part will collect the miss.  After a few days, reverse the pad and fold the other edge under.  Discard  the pad when it becomes intolerable to you, but remember dogs are drawn to scents; so pristine pads are not a magnet, whatever the age of the dog.",0

"I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home.

Being a Star Trek fan I approached this Finnish homage to the franchise with some trepidation.  Apart from the costumes there was really no attempt to emulate the moral fortitude of our well known heroes such as Spock and Captain Kirk.  In this version morality flew out of the window.  That said I will concede that the special effects were outstanding.,0

"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see.",0

Runs smooth and very responsive though i highly recommend the keyboard as typing on a touch screen is a bit less fun than on a real keyboard.

Any complaints about the back being flexible and creaky plastic are hardly noticeable. If anyone is having trouble finding one still, i definitely owe getting mine to nowinstock.net!

"This case is the perfect companion for your Minecraft minis!!  The compartments are actually big enough that you can get two into most of them to double its effective storage.  Some of the Minecraft minis are bigger and don't fit with two in one compartment, but for the most part they work great.  It folds together into a block (nice touch) and has a very good latching mechanism that blends well with the case design.  You could also store a few into the play area of the case when you close it up.  While not very large, when the case opens up there is a play area on the back with several blocks painted to resemble various ores.  A nice little touch.  The plastic seems to be very durable and is a nice looking product overall.  Yes, it is a bit pricey compared to the Dollar Tree storage boxes that my son's figures were in, but he is so happy to have them in their own official home.

"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",0

"Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.",0

"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",0

"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product.",0

"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!",0

"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one.",0

"At first I thought this book was taking place along time ago, because being from the USA, it's hard to think women are not even close to being equals with men,  in many parts of the world. It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type. The romance builds, which I also liked, they just don't fall head over heels for each other and have sex right away.",0

"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a piece of non fiction so much.  It reads like a novel, but a novel where I had a small part in the plot.

I remember the controversey that surrounded Bonnie and Clyde.

I have used it for many different things - it cut paper smoothly, right out of the box; I've peeled fruit & veggies with it; opened packages with it; widdled some twigs with it; cut wires; and even pried open a metal lid that was tightly seeled.

It's thumb release is wonderful and makes opening the knife quick and extremely easy. One-handed operation.

It's sturdy, looks good and has a substaintal pocket clip that holds the knife securely in place while not being difficult to remove when needed. It feels good in the hand and I've used it for about a half hour straight when peeling potatoes at one point without any fatigue.

Great item and I'm planning on getting a second as a spare (maybe for the car).",0
"This is a nice, big, bulky, lightweight, comfortable sleeping bag.  It's been used by a couple of people and I am very happy with the purchase.  The material is nice and soft and it's not too large or bulky.  I like that it has a lot of pockets to hold stuff or things",1
"This is really the absolute best piece of glass in the price range. People comparing it to scopes that cost two or three times as much are missing the picture. You just aren't going to find a Mil/Mil FFP scope with usable glass at this price from anyone else.

The picture is bright, clear, and distortion free. The reticule is straight, perfectly centered, and sharp. The turrets are very good, with the smallest amount of wiggle but nothing that matters. The whole thing is very solid, with firm, positive adjustment at the eyepiece.

At the highest powers you do get a bit of haze, but nothing that renders it unusable. The range I usually shoot at is frequently overcast, and even in less than ideal light I've never had a problem with contrast, even with the magnification set to maximum (14x).

It has held zero through approximately 900 rounds of .308 with no signs of problems. A box drill brought 0.75"" groups back to overlapping at 100 (+/- 2) yards",0

"Totally not what I expected from this prequel/sequel.  The writing did not flow for me and I struggled to keep the characters all separate and identify who was who and what was what.  A bit of a weak reasoning behind what ""caused"" Hannibal to be Hannibal the Cannibal.  In fact, I felt there was a big contradiction in the explanation as Hannibal was so disgusted by the Cannibalism that went on during the war (ok it was his sister they ate) that I did not truly believe that he would resort to it himself.

I am left wanting a further book to bridge the significant gap between this one and the rest of the Hannibal Lector books.

I originally gave it 3 stars out of 5 but when I actually sat down to write my thoughts and feelings, I downgraded to 2 stars as I could not justify any more than that.",0

"We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!",0

"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",0

"I enjoyed it very much. It was fast paced and exciting. I also liked how Riddle (pen name?) tied in the Spanish flu--with its mysterious cytokene storm. I have to admit I don't quite understand how the ""bell"" disease vector worked exactly.

Coincidentally? Stephen King's--The Stand--worked in an almost identical fashion with the first exposed dying within minutes and those secondarily exposed later taking a couple of days and then several days to die, while those who were immune were just immune.

I realize that no novel can tell everything, but there are a crucial two months missing, where a plague apparently swept the Earth and the ""Immari Imperium"" began. Finally, and for me the most vexing thing, is the fact that there are aliens beneath the Antarctic and we don't know a thing about them except that they built a device that transmits a virulent plague. When you engage in biological warfare, what you are after is extermination. Not a good omen when they are a vastly technologically superior visitor. Ask the Native Americans!",0
"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!",0

You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.

She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.

My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements.

I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.

"Aurora Rose Reynolds took possessive to a whole new level with Justified and I LOVED every single second of it. Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!

"I purchased the Coolaroo Elevated Core for my cat and it is a nice size for him.  It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to adjust.  It does not stay on very well.  I will be replacing it for the next cat.  I have the most trouble with the plastic clasp on the top of the collar.  I have had to use a different clasp on the top because it is hard to see the clasp on the collar.  I have tried other brands, but they all seem to have just the same problem.  I am having trouble adjusting the collar because it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I was worried about my cat getting too close to the collar and getting it to go in the air.  It is very easy to adjust and I would recommend it.  I have a very hard time getting my cat to use it.  I would recommend this collar for a very hard and experienced cat.  If your cat is a big chewer, it is probably worth it.  I was very disappointed in this collar because the size was too large.  It is made from plastic and it is a bit difficult to put on, but it is perfect for my cat.  It is very soft and my cat is a little bit fussy.  I was surprised by the quality of the collar.

"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

"Quiet,strong,handsome,shy when it comes to women, has trouble making decisions and the inability to  say ""NO"" to anyone describe this Hot, Hunky, Cowboy version of a tarnished saint. James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint.",0

"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

"3.5 torn stars, rounded up. I liked the story, but it was a cliffhanger, which I really don't like at all. When I invest hours of precious time in a story, get into it, and then discover I have to buy the next ""x"" number of books to find out what happens and get some closure, I'm not happy.

Besides that, I did like the story. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, and this one was different enough from the usual to be fresh and interesting. After a slow start detailing the travels of the heroine, things really picked up when she finally found what she'd been looking for all along - a vampire. The characters were likable enough, though some plot lines seemed a little forced. Paranormal secondary characters were enjoyable, but I found the heroine's best friend to be pushy and kind of obnoxious.

I'm not sure if I'll grab the next one, knowing I'm setting myself up for another cliffhanger (did I mention I really don't like cliffhangers?). It will depend on if the story sticks with me in the next couple of weeks.",0

I never felt a connection to the heroine and then I really didn't like the lies she told her supposed best friend, who had helped her and also set her up with her cousin.

Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this.",0

Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction.

I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone.",0

"I was excited to get this set, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money you spend on it.  The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little more detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very classy curtain.love this!  it works well, but I wish it was more sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser for a baby shower.  They work great.  I used them for our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them for the bedding for a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.  I would definitely recommend these.  I was worried they might not last long.  They are great for the price.  I would buy these again.  I hope they last a long time.I've had a few of these for a few months now and they haven't cracked or cracked. I have tried a couple of them and they're all so much easier to clean. They're not so much thicker than some of the others I've tried, but they're still so thick and easy to clean",1
"I have owned this TV for a couple years now and I still love it. I have one in my bedroom and the other in a garage. The TV is a bit of a pain to operate, especially when it's outside in the sun. I have had to turn it off for about 10 minutes before it starts to dim and it's getting dark and it gets dark so I'm not sure if I will ever use it anymore. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a pain to install. You can't get it to actually charge it up, but it does have a short USB port so you have to plug it in first to get it to work. I have the TV plugged in to the wall and I can't get it to even start working. Also, the remote is pretty annoying. I would have given this 5 stars if I could.I really like the case.  It's a nice fit.  The only thing I would change",1

"It another one of those movies where twins are played by the same actor.
This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap.
But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.
This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.
Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins
as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.
This very old visual trick never works.
You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with
each other.
This film might have even been interesting if they had used
two different actors who look kind of alike.
But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express.
Don't waste your time.",0
Old movie.  It is a real shame.  Not for children.  It's a sad movie.  Great story and the acting is good.  Great action.  I would recommend it to any person.

"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders...",0

"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",0

"I am searching online to find an easy way to make this shirt work for me. I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and it is stretchy. The material is not see through so it will be fine if you don't have a lot of pockets. The bottom is a bit snug but I can wear it on my shoulder and I'm sure it will stretch. The top is a bit too small but I like that it's not too tight. I'm sure it will be fine. I've only worn it twice so I don't know how it will hold up. I haven't worn it at all yet but I'm sure it'll be fine.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and ordered a medium for my 5'8"", 195lbs, the size I normally wear was too big.

The only problem that I encountered was the left chainguard was broken during shipping.  I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service).

"It was a long time coming, this book, ""One Was a Soldier."" It downloaded to my Kindle and I dug in happily. I had to pace myself, as my inclination was to inhale it in one sitting. The story itself is something of a departure from the standard mystery format. The serious issues facing veterans returning from war take center stage for at least the first third of the book, and, after the actual mystery kicks in, Spencer-Fleming continues to pull this thread through to the end. The relationships among the characters that began in earlier novels in the series are brought forward and developed further. What I enjoy most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way her characters remain true to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with issues surrounding re-entry into her life as pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effects of the war in which she has just been engaged have changed her and altered her reality. She has the same issues as other soldiers who return from combat. But Clare is a priest, and donning her collar, along with all its attendant expectations, makes dealing with those issues that much more difficult. In her construction of the dialogue, the author makes Clare's very human struggle apparent and sympathetic.

Other writers here have reviewed the story in greater detail. A lot happens in ""One Was a Soldier."" There is significant progress in the story for all the characters, but there is plenty left on the bone for the future. I await the next installment in the series excitedly. Spencer-Fleming is a fine writer. Her novels never disappoint.",0

The opening was executed with precision leaving me a bit stunned. And then there is the promise dictated by the Book of Hours- find true love; something most of us want, so it keeps you reading and digging your heels in. This book has some of everything-love, desire, betrayal and even show biz. Dangerous Liaisons indeed.

"WEAK ON CURRENT SCIENCE.
After seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I'll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a ""Wild Food Expert"") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an ""author and weight loss expert"" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America's cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her ""It's not fat that makes you fat - it's sugar"" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds. Olive Oil is NOT a health food.

"Very nice micro case but could use some improvements, primarily on the hard drive cage.  Overall this case is easy to work with as most parts unscrew and can be removed such as the top and the motherboard tray.  Wiring can be tricky so a modular power supply and shorter SATA cables can pay off here.  Lots of room for your CPU heatsink of choice and a large fan blowing from the front that cools well even at very low RPM's.  The two main complaints I have for this case are the orientation of the hard drive cage which should be rotated 90 and the lack of sound deadening materials in the side panels.  Otherwise this is a great case that is very compact for what it holds and rewards you for your efforts.",0

They are a little tight around the knees, but I do not think I will be able to get them on my knees for long periods of time.I love these shoes! I have been wearing them for years now and I have no complaints. I love that they are made with a nice color and are made with a good quality material.

"I like how this book picks up right where the first book left off. I enjoyed it more than the first book and was very surprised on how Jenny Lynne made it work. I really didn't know how it was going to work out. As usual, the characters are their awesome selves. The book was filled with betrayal, action, and drama worth reading. I was satisfied with the ending of the pretend story told in the hospital room and the actual story. It made me hopeful for a better future to make the sacrifice worth it. The book held my attention the whole way through. I'm not really sure what else to say. I really thought it was well put together.",0
VERY SATISFIED........... EXCELLENT VERY HAPPY!!!!Very good quality,1
"I got his Women's Silicone Roller & I Love It. I also love that it's been used to make two different sizes of roller, both of which have different weights. The only thing that I do like about this roller is that it's a little thicker than my previous one. The texture of the roller is very soft and it's a little thicker than my previous roller. I also like that the roller has a handle that can be used to push the roller down when I'm not using it. I also like that the roller has a small, rubber ring that I can use to hold it in place and put it on. The roller also has a tiny, plastic sleeve that I can use to cover my face. I also like that the roller has a rubber liner that I can use to keep my face warm and dry. I also like that the roller is a little more flexible and helps prevent wrinkles. Overall I really like this roller and would recommend it to anyone. I bought this roller for my wife and she loves it.",1
"This has become my default starter set, and my kids love it.  It's been a great addition to their classroom and I am glad to have it.  It is very sturdy and it's well made.  The carpet is very soft and the pieces are very well made.  We have used it with our 11 month old twins and they love it.  It has held up well to a few rough edges and seems sturdy enough.  I like that the pieces are very small and that the pieces don't fall out.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" edge to it and that it is really sturdy.  We have not had any problems with the pieces falling out.  The only complaint I have",1

"This is one of Angelina Jolie's best films; everbody in this film plays thier roles exceptionally well. The plot is very well crafted and the action stupendous, although somewhat unbelievable. The portent of the film changes somewhat during its course, making the film even more attractive; this is definately worth viewing twice.",0
"Like ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, another recent bestseller that left me cold, I found STATION ELEVEN too (self)-consciously crafted, too mannered, to enjoy. I was never able to escape into the story; the writing, gorgeous as it was, always kept me at arm's length, reminding me that I was reading, well, gorgeous writing. (The plot was pretty predictable too; how many ""virus-ends-the-world"" narratives do we need?) This is not a criticism of the author's abilities, but I personally enjoy novels that are a bit less polished, novels that allow me to forget the craft and lose myself in the story. It's a fine line, I'll admit--too little craft calls attention to itself as surely as too much. But there is a balance, and for me, this novel didn't achieve it.",0

"Much smaller than I expected, and has the same feel. I will keep this in the tool box. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, and the size is perfect. I used it for the lighting in my family's room and it has a very low output (just a little over 10 watts). It does not have a flashing light on it, but it does have a very bright light. I would recommend this bulb to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great. I love the way the light is dimmed, but I like the fact that I can see them in the dark. I like the fact that they are 3/4 inch thick, which is nice. I would recommend them to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little too large for my use. I bought a small set and it is a bit larger than expected. I think it's a design flaw. I have not used it yet, but it is working perfectly. This is the only one I have that will work with the Samsung SmartThings hub.",1

"I said just what I needed, and I meant it. This book goes into a lot of detail, however I was particularly interested in the sections on plants that work well, gardening bed ideas, the tools, and reading about the disadvantages. I live in a small but tall building with plenty of room on the roof. The space is not shared, so my wife has always wanted to grow her own vegetables on the roof. She got the idea from an article about urban agriculture, and she always wanted to know more. After I read the book, it was clear that it is perfectly possible, without the disadvantage of the cost mentioned. In my opinion it is affordable, and this book really showed me how. If you are in a similar situation to me, I would recommend reading this to see just how viable raised garden beds are. Thanks.",0

"Ok so I just got these and they fit really well (In my opinion). Im a womens size 7 1/2 and I got in a mens 6. These are the Rewinds and the seller says that they are in men sizes only.

When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.

So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels.",0

"Kian goes from being a playboy and ""the spare"" to Crown Prince in the blink of an eye when his twin brothe, Garrett, is kidnapped. For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story..",0

"Having just watched McFarland USA with Costner which I think was a good movie, it was tough for me not to compare the two movies and Costners portrayals a bit. Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected. To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well. This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own. There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so. It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know. This is not a bad movie by any means as it is a good family movie that can start a conversation but it does seem to lack something that could make it more. 3 to 3.",0

The other two cameras I've tried, both have excellent sound and are easily adjustable.

The only downside is the battery life, which is about the same as an average DSLR.

I'm not a pro photographer and I'm not sure if it would be worth it to take a lot of shots with it, but it is nice to have an external camera, so I don't have to worry about losing the battery.

The only downside is that the battery life is a little short, but it is still usable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the camera and recommend it to anyone looking to get professional DSLR photography.

"First off, I'm a cable cutter, got tired of paying big $$ for basic tv.  Kept my internet so netflix and amazon are my primary movie outlets.

Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!

"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money.",0

"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating.",0

All I Want for Christmas is a Duke is an anthology about women who fall in love with dukes and their love is finally returned around Christmas time.
The first story The Duke and Duchess Trap reminded me of the Parent Trap story. The duke and duchess have twin girls and when they separate, each one takes a daughter. The girls meet a few years later in a boarding school. On Christmas break, they both return to the other parent. To get the correct daughter back, the parents must reunite.
Sophie and the Duke revolves around a duke looking for a wife by having a masked ball. He meets a childhood friend at the ball but he doesnt remember her right away. As time goes on, he gets a few clues as to who she is and realizes that she still intrigues him.
A scientific formula is the basis of The Dukes Christmas Wish. The Duke of Vale comes up with a marriage formula to get accepted into society, except he didn't figure love into the equation.
Lady Patience helps out a person stranded in a snowstorm in One Magic Season. Unbeknownst to her, it is an old flame of hers. But she cant leave him stranded to freeze. So she faces her fears and insecurities to offer him a place to stay until the storm abates.

"I've used Krylon paint with great results before. However, this paint is not up to par. Firstly, I seem to have gotten a bad can. When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon.",0

"Saw Jaws in 75' when I was 7 and then Grizzly came out in 76', the time was about 6-8 months between these two films and it was plain to see this movie was a cash in on the killer animal craze that ran through the mid to late 70s starting with the famous Spielburg film. Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service. A 18 foot two thousand pound grizzly goes on the rampage taking out campers , a couple of park rangers before coming to the final showdown with the George character who instead of a scuba tank uses a Lors rocket launcher to destroy the bear. I still enjoy watching it after all these years could have given it 5 stars but that might be pushing it a bit to far. This 2 disc edtion is far better than a earlier version I brought.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!",0

"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again",0

"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate.

woof it is Harvey. I have an older cat and a small dog. These work well and the extra hair helps. The plastic part is also very light and easy to wash. I have used this product for about a year now.,1
It's very comfortable. I'm always hot so I do have to turn it once in awhile during the night. It's just me....when I do move it just a little it's nice and cool. I've not had any neck issues since it arrived and I slept on it the first time. I can hardly wait to go to bed and put my head on it at night. I would suggest that if you have an issue with any pillow you are using you might want to give this a try.,0
I use for me and it has kept me cool. I also love that it's been one of my favorite things to use. I love that the ring is not so thin and it's not so heavy. It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel like I'm getting a full ring because I'm not,1

Lacey had a terrible time with the guys and decided to quit her job. She was just starting a new job and her friend, Danielle, is the head of the sports marketing company that she's been working on. She's a bit of a Dom and doesn't want to give up on a woman she's attracted to. She's been lusting after him since she was a child and just didn't want to give up on him.

She meets Ben, a Dom who's been in love with her since they were teens. He's not exactly a Dom but he's a Dom. He wants her to have sex with him but he's not willing to give up on her. When she's in a bad mood she goes home to her parents to see how it will go.

Ben and Lacey are in the same bed together but he's not sure how to act on that. He wants her to have sex with him but she doesn't want to. She's just afraid of the guy.

"Yes, I understand the viewpoint of the reviewers who thought that this was not Tuchman's best work, because it certainly is different from Guns of August or Zimmerman, with their relentless and suspenseful narratives.
Nonetheless, this book represents brilliant work and sumptuous writing. In fact, I agree with those reviewers who think it may be her best work.  The book is a collection of essays, any one of which could stand proudly and separately. But when linked together, the separate chapters become a glorious symphony of historical insight.
When I was finished the book, I realized that I hadn't quite understood how the pieces fit together.  So I read the book again.  That's when I saw what a dazzling accomplishment this was. Indeed, like a symphony.
The book may even be worth a third read.  It's that good.",0

"I received this UPS a couple days ago and found it was fully charged when I received it.  This is my first Tripp Lite UPS.  I have been a loyal APC user for my entire computing life.  I figured I would see if TL is any better.  I was surprised that the battery was already hooked up and fully charged when the device arrived.  I let it run for two days.  First day had no load and second had a minimal load.  Tonight I installed the unit in my media center.  So far I have had no issues and no smell as reported by others.  I currently use this UPS in my media center to keep a TV, sound system, CATV box and DVD running.  Current full load is without the DVD and usage is at 37%.  With everything turned off, I still see a draw of 9%.

The only thing that is slightly annoying, and why I gave this item a 4-star review, is that I cannot figure out how to turn off the LCD display when I did not need it.  It is a nice night light in the living room, but I would rather have the display go out automatically or even manually.  I read documentation offline and online and found no clues.  I sent an email to tech support but haven't heard anything after 3 days.  Guess I will call their Chicago phone number and ask.  Unfortunately I only remember to call after they close.

Otherwise, the unit seems to be solid.  Minus the inability to figure out how to turn off the display, I am happy with my purchase.  Time will tell if I switch to Tripp Lite, try someone else or go back to APC.",0
Made in USA.  Wanted to like them but they run small.,0
"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!",0

"I was shipped the UK version (live in US and ordered i US).  When I tried to redeem the Ultraviolet code, I was given an error message that the code will not work in the US.  How dissappointing as I only bought this movie for two reasons: 1) to stream while away from home and 2) To watch in 3D at home.  Now I am concerned that this UK version will not play on my US 3D Bluray player.  Beware buying this version.

UPDATE - a user posted in the comments of this review a method to redeem UK Ultraviolet codes on a US account.  It worked, so I now have my digital copy also.  I also tried the disc on my 3D Blu-ray player and it does work.  I have what I wanted so I am now satisfied.",0

"The Zillionz Talking Cash Register (CBT) is a good learning tool for kids. It has a lot of colorful parts and the kids can also get the instruction booklet to take it apart and put it back together. It is a great way to learn about money and money-making. I highly recommend it.

Also, it is very easy to set up and use. I will say that if you want to learn money and money-making, this is a great learning tool.

I would highly recommend this for kids ages 4 & up.  I recommend it for a great price.  Highly recommend this.This was a gift for my daughter who loves Lego and was very excited to see it.

"My youngest daughter, my niece and their friends are all into Monster High dolls, so this was a very welcome addition to the collection.  The playset is huge!  Even though the box was somewhat large, I was still surprised by the size of the finished product.  Speaking of which, it requires some relatively minor assembly.  Once assembled, it can either be used as a play toy or a large themed display case for over a dozen dolls for the types who are more into collecting the dolls rather than playing with them.  My oldest daughter collected Bratz years ago and still has them preserved in their fancy custom themed storage cases to this day.  She rarely actually played with them.  On the other hand, my youngest daughter and my niece are more into playing with their dolls than collecting, so this playset sees a lot of action.  It can also be used for both purposes.  It's durable enough to withstand hours of regular play and the dolls can be stored inside on decorative display when not in use.  The playhouse is somewhat sturdy but can be a little shaky at times and has several moveable parts, some of which seem like they may be easily broken if your child is a little too rough.  Speaking of dolls, none are included with the playset.  I ordered two new dolls so I could present them along with the playset.  It just seemed more exciting to surprise her with the playset along with new dolls instead of just the playset alone.  The girls absolutely love it so far.  It's definitely a worthwhile pickup if you have a young girl who plays with or collects Monster High dolls.  Just make sure there is plenty of room for storage and play, because  like I said... It's huge.",0

"The Battery keeps discharging - almost every time I need to use it, it's dead or near dead.

It was so easy to set the table for my last dinner party with the ""good stuff"".

"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try ""Lost Horizon,"" a terrific tale of Shangri-La. This one is fine if you have an hour and a half to kill.",0

"This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it. I don't see the purpose of spending the money on this--UNLESS you have trouble lifting the litter and it's either expensive (light) litter or no cat! THEN I say, this does the job, AND it's light!

"I am so glad I got to read this book. It turned out to be an excellent book with a message that I definitely needed to hear.

I was unsure if I would benefit from this book. After all, I don't really have any enemies, not in the human form anyway. But i do at times battle addiction, fear, anxiety, depression... would this book help me understand God's purpose for our own internal struggles?

The answer is yes. Anything you face - any person, any struggle, any weakness - may feel like an enemy. But sometimes your enemy is your best opportunity. ALL things work together for good! God may use an enemy to bring about your great purpose & destiny. But it is all worth it in the end!

Life can be hard. It seems like we have barely made it through one battle, when we're facing another. But this book is a great encouragement & testimony to the fact that God is with us & sees us face our enemies. He knows, and it isn't him punishing or being angry with us! He is actually just using these trials to promote us to the next level.

I think this book was well-written. I also liked how it was broken down into short chapters. It made it seem like an easier read that way! Ron Carpenter used personal examples, too, which was very helpful in knowing that He has been through some HARD TIMES as a pastor but that God truly brought him through it!",0

"High Noon is one of my husband's all time favorites. It's got some terrific lines in it. He's always quoting one of them. I bought this for his 71st birthday and he watches it at least twice a month. We like the fact that in the day and time this movie was made, foul language was unacceptable! Oh, that this was true today! It's a ""must see"" movie and worth every penny to buy it.",0
"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions.",0

"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either. She uses a pee pad because she refuses to use a litter box so I'd definitely notice if her poop smelled stronger!",0
Such fun for little girls. Pieces went together great. The detail is nice.,0

"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.

Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.

This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place.",0
"although the beginning of the book has you wondering what is going to happen next, I recommend you read the first part first and get your hands on the rest of the books.

"I download a lot of books but rarely read them all the way through.  This was different -- I enjoyed learning more about the gaming world, there was romance and a good plot, and enough sex for those who want it.  It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.  Oh, and the techie terms and name pronunciations should have been up front or referenced at the beginning.  Looking forward to reading more from this author!",0

"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon. The tag says ""Earth Brown"" but is not the color shown on the ordering page.

I won't knock it a star for that though I'd rather have the Earth Brown I ordered, or at least something that resembles Earth Brown more than a bar of chocolate.",0

"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take.",0
"Kate Pearces Retribution is a read that may have triggers for some, so read with caution.  Now that being said this book is a really good read.  Sacrifice, Book 1, needs to be read before this one so that all of the background information on the tribute program and the world they live on is explained.  Kai Mexr was Commander Rehzs right hand man and was supposed to retire when his last mission ended, but he was forced to come back as a trainer for another mission.  His new trainee is Aled Price another person with human genetics and stubborn streak a mile wide.  Kai and Aled butt heads from the very beginning, but realize that they need each other to survive.  They have to deal with the harsh realities of training, and when that is over, the treatment at the hands of the Ungrich.  Palk set his sights on Kai and his trainee and makes sure his presence is felt to both men.  Aled realizes that Kai doesnt believe he deserves better than being taken roughly and without any choices in how he is taken, but trying to make Kai see that he deserves more may be battle too big for Aled.  We see Anna and Rehz in this book as well since the Ungrich seem to have set their sights on human DNA.  Both pairs realize that if their secret is not protected then they will be targets for the military to use them.  When Aled goes in to get his medical clearance and to finally be free to pursue a life with Kai, he is taken for the Ungrich, as is Anna.  Both Kai and Rehz now need to join forces and go rescue their mates.  This book ends on a cliffhanger.  I give this book 4 stars!",0

If you are looking for a regular monopoly game, this is not it. You can play it like a regular game,  but that is not the intended purpose, so I would rather have the original version if I wasn't going to personalize.  I think this is a perfect gift for the one person that loves Monopoly.  We own the dot com version, spiderman, electronic, regular etc.

My boys have already personalized the cards.  Their dad is very kind and sweet and always jokes that he will ""drop the hammer"" if they don't stop whatever it is they are doing...The boys made him a card that says dad dropped the hammer, go directly to jail.  That is just one example of the personalization of cards.

See the video for the inside of the box, as well as the pieces. I thought this would help so you could see exactly how you personalize it.

Pros: Fun twist on Monopoly

Cons: Not great if you don't want to personalize.  I don't like the four folding board.  They always break! No small labels for the properties or the corresponding pieces on the board.

I was not initially that excited for this game, and once I saw exactly how you personalize it, I am really excited to complete the personalization and give it to my husband for his birthday!",0

I highly recommend this product.Perfect for my kids and it works great!I'm a huge fan of LED lighting, and this is my second one. I bought it to replace a ceiling fan that was installed to replace the ""top of the house"" light fixture I had. It's a great little light, with a very cool white tint and a nice warm white light. I love the low beam angle and the wide beam of the LED. I use this to hang a sheet of hanging paper in the ceiling.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit too small for a laptop. The keyboard is small, and it's not in the same position as a regular laptop keyboard. But it's not the best laptop keyboard I have ever owned. I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or a problem with the cable itself. Maybe I just need to get some other cord to connect the keyboard to the cable.

I'd be happy with this cable if it was made by a company that doesn't make cables.I like this case because it has the included charger that makes it easy to charge my phone and laptop. I also like the color and the way the case is folded. It's a great little case for the money.Love the case and I would recommend it.Works great.I really like the mounting hardware but I didn't like the instructions on the other reviews.

"Somebody to Love is the third book in the Cupid, Texas series by Lorie Wilde.  Jericho Chance is a sexy cowboy turn scholar.  He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly.",0
"A very good non-slip mat for use with any dough owing to its large 16"" size. The circle guides are helpful and the information on the sides are for quick look-up. Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling. The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage. I just use damp paper towel (or wet) to clean the mat and air dry it by hanging.",0

"I'm not a comic reader and have never read the ones for Spiderman, I'm more of a movie fan so if you are looking for a review that compares this movie to the comics this review may not be helpful for that.  I have watched the Spiderman trilogy that came out in the 2000s and thought they were pretty well done, but for some reason I enjoyed this Spiderman more.  For example, I found the character of Spiderman rather annoying in the trilogy whereas I could relate to his character better in this one.  I also like how this version had more background to the story as it started off with Peter Parker as a child living with his parents and touches a little bit upon his dad and how he was a very secretive man.  I also found the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane really annoying in the Trilogy but the relationship he had with Gwen Stacy was more realistic and not over dramatized.  The fighting scenes were typical superhero style of fast paced and lots of smashing with the hero seeming to be the weaker out of the two but that is what is expected from these movies.  Of course there were many similarities played out differently in this movie when compared to the first of the older Trilogy.  For example, the spider bite, the fate of the uncle, Peter letting a thieve go due to his irritation with the person being robbed, the split personality of the villain, and so on.  They were just played out quite differently.  Peter Parker in this movie was also much funnier I thought; especially when he is dealing with the car thieve.  I found it to be an overall enjoyable movie and just about anyone who likes action will like it and my 6-year-old son really enjoyed it so it is a good movie for the younger generation.",0

"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",0

Lifespan of the batteries in the number pad (it's been dead for a while, but the keyboard is still operating on the same batteries that came with it). Doesn't fit in a keyboard tray correctly.

"King Hall is the first book in this paranormal romance series. If you like Elementals, vampires, mages and shifters this is the book for you. The four mystical prodigies Ezra, Pearl, Jack and Lily are the future kings and queens and they have some wicked powers. There is action, love, loss and an amazing friendship in this story. I loved the way they bonded always being there for each other no matter what. The story was easy to read. There were some great twists in the story keeping you on edge always wanting to find out what happens next. And Scarlett ends this first book with a great cliffhanger and I hope she doesn't keep us waiting to long for book two. I am definitely looking forward to continuing the story and finding out what happens next.",0

I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This book was great for my 6 year old daughter who loves reading.  She loves to read about the old times.  I loved reading about the school she is in.  She was really excited about this book and was happy to read it.  It is a wonderful story of a wonderful family.  The stories are amazing and I can't wait to see what happens next.  This book is the best book I have read in a long time.

"I deducted one star for the size and quality of the item.  If you have a larger head than me, the sizing chart will not work for you.  I would say go with a medium.  It will be a little bit larger for my size.  If you have a large head, it will be a bit bigger.  If you are a medium, you will need to adjust the size to your desired size",1
I've searched all over for a harness that would fit my dog perfectly. This harness is the answer. It's adjustable and is easy to adjust. The dog is tall and it's adjustable enough to fit him comfortably. It's a perfect size for my dogs and is comfortable. The material is soft and plush,1
"Details are always a great deal. The quality is just right.  The pockets are a little small.  The material is nice, but the zipper is a bit loose.  The only thing I would say is that the size is way too small.  Otherwise, it's a great shirt.  I have a wide chest and I can wear it on jeans or skirts.  I wish I would have gotten the larger size.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband.  The waistband is a little too loose for my narrow waist.  However, it does help with long work hours.

"Thankfully this book was not written to be an escape from the cold. It was written to be a read. The reader must be able to adapt to the new world and circumstances that it is living in. The characters are well developed. This is a very good book. I recommend it to anyone who is new to the world of fantasy. I've read all of Stephen King's books and I love them all. However, this one is very different. The story is about a couple who were estranged from their loved ones for years, but just couldn't get enough of each other. This book was a great read. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it immensely. The author does an excellent job of explaining the relationship between Stephen and Rose. Both are very strong people with a strong bond and love. The story is about the situation Stephen and Rose were in when they were separated. There was a lot of backstory that I didn't know about at all, but I loved it.",1
"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book.",0

"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again!",0

I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working as I hoped. I would definitely recommend.I bought this to replace my old one, it is a good size and sturdy, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It does not have the finish of the old one. It has a plastic grip that keeps the lid from being stuck.

Very sturdy with some stiff flex (the board has a curve) that makes it very nice to ride. For those wondering why they should buy this, one word, WATER. I live in Florida where it rains often so using my normal bamboo board is pretty much not a good idea. If it rains I'll just take this bad boy and worry not about any puddles. Also it's a great gift, so buy with confidence.",0

"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand. With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this.",0

"I purchased 5 of these trays total (2 - 1/4"", 2 - 3/8"", 1 - 1/2"") and was able to condense 2 drawers down to one drawer.  And I was able to add an additional socket set that i kept in it's own case.  I have broken a couple of the clip/adapters as they are plastic.  It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

I used to have those bottomless trays you lay in the drawers and your sockets fit in the holes.  Your sockets were not mobile like they are with these trays and  There was A LOT of wasted space.",0
"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",0

"I bought this kennel to use on my cat and it is a nice size for him. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to slip it on. The carpet is very thick and it is very easy to clean. It is very easy to clean and it has a very soft feel to it. I also like that it has a pull handle to keep it on. I like that it is so easy to put on and take off. The only thing I would change is that I put it in a larger size box and put it in a closet where it would be easier for me to get it off. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate. I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be. He is very active and has not gotten into fights with other people. I have used this product for a few months now and he seems to be able to get used to it. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my dogs. I would recommend this product.

"This was a beautifully crafted movie, gritty, suspenseful, well written and wonderfully acted. It told a nice detective yarn with real characters, well developed characters. There was enough grime and blood to be titillating but not in my opinion over the top. The pacing was just right; It flowed beautifully right down to the wonderfully done pull at the close of the last scene. It was almost really good. But the script pulled me out of it too many times. The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it. I imagine it would feel okay to someone who had read the novel but in the movie it was sometimes insufficient to suspend belief. That being said I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. I would watch another with this character.",0

Then the felt actually acquired a couple more knots from how quickly I was waving it over the next few days.  The knots add to the appeal, making a bit of noise and giving her something more substantial to catch and chew on!",0

I can't say I've ever had an electrician who didn't need a charge for the first couple of months. I had a friend who was a lifetime electrician who had a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers. I was very excited about the idea of using the lithium ion battery and a 2 AAA battery to charge the batteries. I have a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers and had to install a lot of batteries on my electrician's old electrician's motor. I wanted to be able to charge the batteries in the same way that I was able to use a battery powered electrician. So I used the Lutron Lithium Ion Battery. I was very impressed with this battery. I also had no issues with the batteries. I like the fact that I can charge the batteries in the same way as the battery powered electrician. I also like the fact that the battery is not a single AA battery. It is a single,1

The second chapter is a bit different. I was interested to see how the authors were going to develop their characters and how they would write about the lives of the people involved in the events.

"Another top quality product by SKLZ.

I'm using the lateral resistor to train my 8 year old son in speed/agility/quickness. I can also use it myself. The cuffs for the ankles are comfortable and fit children and adults of all sizes. they fasten together with strong velcro that doesn't separate when the product is being used.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

Every SKLZ SAQ training product comes with the same DVD and the 2nd side of the poster is the same for each product. One side of the poster is always devoted to training with only that product.

It's a good accompaniment for a complete SAQ training program.",0

"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

"I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews on this bag, but I was pleasantly surprised with it once it arrived. First of all, this is a very, very large bag. Almost too big for everyday use. It would be a great diaper bag or travel bag. It comes with a removable shoulder strap which is great. It has several pockets, but they're quite large as well. A drop in bag organizer would be great for this. The quality is a little less that I would like. The canvas is very thin and the lining is this as well. I'm not sure how this bag would hold up to everyday use. I checked the stitching on it and it seems pretty sturdy. My favorite thing about this handbag is the color. I got the yellow and blue and I think it's absolutely gorgeous. My only worry about this bag is how well it will hold up over time, but I will update my review if needed.

"Worth the wait! These bad boys sat on my wishlist for 2 years. I was SO glad to finally see them at a price I could afford. I got the 8W. I usually wear 8-8.5, and though I prefer a wide, I can wear most regular width shoes. These happen to fit me beautifully, but they don't seem like a true wide width right out of the box. However, the beauty of good quality leather boots is that they will stretch to fit over time. (Google has several good ideas for breaking in leather shoes. Though I didn't need it this time, the rubbing alcohol trick totally works.) I expected these to be tight, but they're not. My calves are about 14.5 inches, and the boots do fit over my leggings or jeans, but with NO room to spare. Keep that in mind if you have large calves. (I noticed that Timberland is now making this type of boot with an elastic inset in the shaft for wider calves. I don't think they are nearly as cute, though.) This boot is GORGEOUS. The leather is such a great color (tobacco) and it looks even prettier now that I've used mink oil on it. I can't wait for Fall so I can wear these boots all the time. They seem to be very well made, very expensive looking. I have short legs, so I love that they stop a few inches below the knee. If they were any taller, I think they'd look like they were wearing me, instead of the other way around. These are absolutely lovely. So many tall boots look cheap or gaudy to me, but these are wonderful. They are so comfortable already, and I know they will only get better. I got a great deal, too, but If I'd known how much I'd love them I would have paid full price 2 years ago!",0

I first ordered for my dog. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend's cat and she's a huge fan of it. The color is beautiful and she loves it.I was skeptical about the price but it was cheaper than the Petco stores. I was going to buy a medium but the dog is a rescue and the size is just right. The handle is nice and strong. It's easy to hold and carry. The leash is very flexible and easy to change. I've never had any issues with the dog pulling on it or it breaking. I like that it's a little longer than the Petco stores which is good because I have a dog,1
"Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all.  It's unique ""oh noooo"" sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play.  A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its ""voice"" go off too which she seemed to like also.  It's good to throw holding by one arm so it does ""cartwheels"".  I have two dogs actually, both under 10 pounds, and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too.  It's holding up very well but nonetheless I'm getting another because she likes it so much and I don't want to be left empty-handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty.  Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up.",0

"I am impressed with each and every 'Reproduction Barbie Doll' that I own. I bought one for each of my four granddaughters, with the hopes of keeping this iconic legend alive. Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than just the doll. I also bought the basic accessories and a few extras. A school classroom set will add to the fun. Also, a dining room, table and chair set with miniature dishes will teach the girls how to set a proper table and reinforce manners. However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurements are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curves or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mothers (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters. The magic moment is when you watch your girls playing alone or with friends and see how they reflect your positive influence. That, in turn, is carried throughout a lifetime. There's a reason Barbie is such a beloved, classic icon.",0

The twists and turns of this book will keep you on the edge of your chair.  It would make a great movie to help expose the problem of human trafficing that takes place around the world.

"Bought this for use on the fire dept as an emergency back up tool. You never know when you are going to have to cut something quick and this seemed to fit the bill. Used to carry a pocket clip style knife (Kershaw) but wanted a razor sharp tool and figured you couldn't get any sharper than an actual razor. I wanted this to be able to cut sheet rock or a seat belt in an emergency situation and standard cardboard boxes around the station . I've had this for many months now it is just not ""cutting it"" The build seems great at first, this thing is really heavy. Unfortunately the build is not that great. The quick release mechanism is already slipping and it doesn't close properly. It feels like its going to break soon. I have actually put this to use maybe a couple dozen times since I received it. (not a whole lot) For the price I thought I was getting a deal but you really do get what you pay for. I compared mine to others who carry the folding box cutters at my station and although my Sheffield looks way better than any of theirs the functionality is not up to par. If you need an occasional junk drawer blade this will work fine. If you are looking for a ""worker"" knife keep looking.",0

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.
-You get all the essentials.",0

As far as the MacBook itself I had a few worries, the screen size only being 13"" inches was one of them. Needless to say I love the size of it! You do not notice that it is 13"" inches because it is actually better than having a huge screen! The screen is perfectly sized! The performance of the product is amazing!

I would have liked to have seen a better solution than the ""go"" button for turning pages, the ""age setting"" is in the book instead of on a parent-switch for this function.. My child happily changes the age setting as often as he presses anything else. It was a good idea, not having a stylus and it works fairly well.. Although my 9 month old smacks the pages and it doesn't actuate the touchpad.. It requires a ""poke"". The books are quite sturdy, they clip into the pad and are made of some kind of plastic material, very sturdy all in all.

"This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking).

VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS.

Size:
Runs one size small, as many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.)  I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know.

Height:
At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not as curiously high as as many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5s surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would.

Fit:
Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me.

Quality/Warmth:
Leather is soft and nice.
Lining is ideal and warm.
The top studs actually keep the laces in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special needs there) a just average).
Can't attest to durability bc they're new.
And, of course, the laces provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper lets you keep it that way (and makes the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot.

WHAT THE ...?!m
There is a slippery finish on the soles that i was sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rubs off as you wear it. Still - makes you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing.  Not cool. Lost a star.",0

"I bought a mixed breed from a breeder that looked 100% like a pure bred, so I got this and sure enough the test showed the 2 and only 2 breeds he's supposed to be. This is a great idea for people with an unknown mix. You need to know what diseases a dog may be prone to get. The vet will probably have a much more accurate result if you want to go that route, but the vets I asked said the test takes 4-6 months and I didn't want to wait. I got the results in 2.5 weeks after the lab received it. I didn't get an email confirmation that it was ready, but I checked every day anyway after 2 weeks. It was no easy task swabbing a puppy, so best of luck to you.",0
Great craftsmenship. Very sharp out of box! I literally closed this and touched it on the inside of my finger and was sliced.  It is a beautiful knife.  I opted for the leather sheath/case and I am really glad I did. I was concerned that the knife would be too small but it's actually the perfect size to wear everyday.,0

I'll admit that I'm not really into history, but I love the historical novels. I'm not sure I like a good",1
"Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro becomes janitor of a dorm populated by a quintet of stunningly beautiful, but dangerously abusive women -- one of which may turn out to be his secret sweetheart who he apparently promised would attend Tokyo U fifteen years ago. The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in.",0
"except for the fact that it has the same materials as the original.

I remembered having one of those ones and thought it was a great deal for a small child. It is so small that it's not worth the extra money. This one is very large and it's a little smaller than I thought it would be. This one is still very cute. I love it. My son loves this game. He is 3 and loves to play with his older brother.,1
"I love these soft claws...I use these as an alternative to the traditional comb for my cats.  They do not have the sharp edges, but they're the right size.  I use these with a small comb and they work well.I have two dogs and this is the only litter box I have found that does not break down.  I have a dog with a strong appetite and she has always been a picky eater. ",1

I don't know about the earlier reviews, maybe problems have been fixed since 2007-2008, but for $125 I have found this drill to be very powerful and sturdy, the chuck has never slipped and the batteries are not only powerful but last a long time and charge super fast.  I am 100% satisfied with with the high quality construction and superior performance of this drill.  In fact, I just finished a project 10 minutes ago with this drill and continue to absolutely love it!",0
This is the second in a series and the first in the series by Stephanie Scott. I just can't get enough of her books. I can't wait to read the next one.

"This was ""the gift"" that my daughter received. She loved it. It's been a great gift for her. I am glad that she is getting it. Great toy! We bought it for our son's 3rd birthday party. He loves it!Fun game. Great for a 2 year old. All in all a great game!Great toy! I love it! My grandson will love it!This is an adorable, cute little party game. My son loves to play with it. It has a variety of ways to interact with the kids. My son has found it a good mix of humor, fun and some great cards to play with. I like that it does not require any assistance from the kids. My son has had a lot of fun playing with this, but I have no doubt he will enjoy it in the long run. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays this game every day. He plays this game at least once a week. It's really fun for the whole family. The game is easy to learn, and I like that there is a lot of replay value. It's not like a game of chess, where you have to win every game and then lose. It's more like a game of musical chairs, with a whole host of rules. It's a great game for a family, and a good way to learn how to count numbers and numbers.",1
I got this for my son for Christmas. He loved it. He loves to play with it and plays with it often. He is 3 and loves to take it out of the car and put it in the trunk.

There was a break in period of about 50 hours. They replaced a pair of Sennheiser 595.  They are very different from the Senns, (which are great headphones as well, just a brighter sound.)  The one caveat is that they are difficult to drive and a headphone amp takes care of that nicely.  I listen to all types of music, but my headphone time tends to be Jazz and vocals and the AKG's don't disappoint.  Also, if you have a large head, as I do:)  you should be careful with these.  They fit, but barely.  Happy listening.",0

I would definitely recommend these gloves to any friend or family member.These are great, but the button is a bit hard to push on.

We also get lovely little treats-lectures on alien cultures and the wonderful healing pets and their adorable fluff ball babies. The reveal of the real reason for the title is much fun.

Very good Science Fiction Romance reading.",0

"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO.",0

"Ill admit some of the changes in the special edition weren't great namely greedo firing first and the new songs in return of the jedi.  but this dvd only serves to make the films look a little better and have better continuity.  Greedo fires first looks a lot better and the timing is more like they fire at the same time.  Jabba and the speeder looks way bettter in a new hope this time.  the emperor and boba fett are played by who they should be played by in empire strikes back.  and anakin appears as he appeared before he ceased to exist.  how could anakin have grown older.  as obi wan says anakin ceased to exist when he became vader.  ill admit it would be nice to have the originals as a bonus feature like on the alien quadrilogy discs, or at least have a comparison feature so you can see the original scenes that were changed like on Star Trek the motion picture, but the fact is the dvd makes all good changes, so stop whining about it.",0

The reviews on this said that they last for a long long time so I am hoping this really keeps going for a while!

I liked the darker blacklight style of the other one as it was dimly lit. This literally lights up the entire 55 gallon tank it is super bright and then lights up the floor around it. Pretty cool looking bulb and supposedly throw heat down towards the snake up to 16 inches. He seems to be more active when this light is on. Hopefully it does not harm him at all.",0

"There was a nasty rumor that an island was going to be visited by aliens, and this one was a big part of the movie, but since the aliens were not in the movie, they just came to the island.

I think it was a very good movie. The aliens seemed to have a lot of energy and it seemed like they were running around with a lot of energy. I just didn't care for it. But if you like the aliens, you will like this one.I love this movie. The acting is top notch, the story is well written, the movie is well acted and the action is well paced. The movie is not as big as the others, but still fun and entertaining. I recommend this movie for those of you who like action, action and adventure.You have to see this movie to really appreciate the good acting. You know that the movies are based on real people and that the characters in the movies are good, but the movie is not realistic. The movie is based on real people and the way the characters are portrayed is not believable. The acting is top notch, the story is well written, the movie is well acted and the action is well paced.

I would have to take it away from him and he'd try to find ways to get the bone. Well this big bone is great! It's been ten minutes of hardcore chewing and he's only left little yorkiepoo teeth marks on the bone (: I highly recommend this bone for dog owners who have dogs that chew through everything! this bone is great (: thanks nylabone and amazon bc this was definitely worth 13 dollars!",0

"I received this belt and I had to return it right away. The Seller did not object, and kindly offered to pay for shipping costs involved. NOTHING was wrong or objectionable with the belt, but despite my efforts to compare my shoes which I placed next to three different computer screens, the color did not match the pair of shoes that I wanted this belt to match.

The reason for this review is because of an issue that I consider of great importance. It is about the Buckle.

Other Sellers offer Ratchet Belts with not only an exceedingly heavy buckle but their buckles have a visible layer of paint. An unacceptable condition occurs when ~in the restroom~ one pulls slacks down. The heavy buckle will drag on the floor, and after several trips to the restroom, approximately half of the painted area has no paint any more. It looks ugly !

This Seller offers the exact same belts with a reliable Ratchet Mechanism and very nice looking leather; but...

Difference #1: the buckle accurately replicate the appealing look of a conventional buckle used for centuries.
Difference #2: there is no paint to scratch.
Difference #3: the buckle is lighter.

BOTTOM LINE - If you guys out there do not want to invest some good money in a belt that everyone notices it is all scratched out and looks ugly just days after you start wearing it, then, this Seller's has resolved that issue brilliantly.

A 75 year old writes a book that is very funny.  She also makes a point of showing how hard it is to get a job and then the job goes to a successful business that takes many years to build.  I am very pleased with the book.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to find a job and get a good start.I love the idea of the story being told in a book. I can't wait to see what happens next.This book was great for me.  It gave me a great perspective into the ways in which our world is in a state of turmoil and despair.  I was especially happy with the way the author did a lot of research on the subject and was able to see the correlation between the two.  I also had a great deal of fun reading about the history of the US as well as the ways in which the two countries have been intertwined in the past.  I thought the author did,1

"These shoes are insanely comfortable.  I wear them all day and they are my go to shoes.  I wear them around the house, at work, or just to cover my feet.  I have had no issues with the heel sticking out.  I have had some issues with the soles breaking.  I have to return them.  I have had several pairs of these shoes.  I have had them for a few months and they seem to be a good quality.  They are very comfortable, very easy to put on, and very soft.  I have had them for a few years and have worn them all day long.  I can't say enough good things about these shoes.  I wear a size 10 and they fit perfectly.  I like the color and style.  I am 5'8"" and the length is perfect.  I ordered the medium and it fits well.  The color is very vibrant.  I love the color and the quality of the fabric.  The fabric is thin and very soft.  I have a hard time finding",1

"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

I did get a free trial of the Belkin CD/DVD player for my kid, but I'm not sure if it will be an issue or not. I don't have any other music on the player but I do know that it is a great player.

I've found that it is a bit difficult to navigate the menus. I wish it had a little more depth and easier to navigate the menus. It is a bit easier to navigate the menus if you are sitting on your couch with your phone in the corner of your living room.

I don't recommend this player to anyone but I will say that this is a great player for a kid of 13 and it",1

"I found this bag to be an excellent quality bag. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two bikes. The front of the bag is the plastic part of the bag and the back is the metal part of the bag. The size is perfect and the bag has no issues with straps breaking. I have also found it to be very comfortable and easy to carry. I also like the fact that there is a separate compartment for the two bags. I will be returning this bag to Amazon for a second one. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was just getting a little tired of wearing my long pants. They didn't fit me perfectly. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a well made backpack.I bought these to use when hiking and for my family.  They are a little hard to pull off the mountain but I do like them.  I have a large head and the size fits me perfectly.  I like the quality of these gloves.  They are made well and are made well.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality pair of gloves.I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", and it is a little large, but it is nice and light. She loves it. The color is a little darker than the stock color, but that's okay with me.

It comes with a nice cover and a handy wrist strap that is nice and secure. There is a way to remove the cover with a screwdriver, but that's not a good feature.

"If you love strategy games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played out in the game.

I'm not sure the word ""fun"" would best describe this game - you are certainly not laughing your way to victory with a wacky group of friends. But if your idea of ""fun"" is deep strategy, constant awareness of how each new event changes the world's politics- and therefore your alliance and chance of winning, and tough decision making, then you will LOVE this game!
I would say the learning curve is moderate as there are a lot of things to keep track of, but once you get a few plays in, things are smooth sailing.

Prior to this game, Dominant Species was my favorite board game. Well move over baby, there's a new game in town!

I used it to light up the garage at night and it works great!I bought this for a friend who has a house, and he uses it constantly.  He uses it frequently and constantly.

"My 6 month old loves this book. She loves to play with all the pieces of it. I like that most everything can't be lost. only the duck on page 4 is not attached somehow.
Each page rundown:
Front has the Velcro removable cow
1. has a attached removable chick and a rattle.
2. has a pig family that you can twirl the mama pigs tail.
 3. a Crinkly tractor moves so you can feel two soft fuzzy sheep.
4. has a duck that snaps easily in and out. (at 6 months she cannot snap it in),
5. a Velcro horse this is permanently attached with a rope.
6. the front cover cow Velcros into place with other cows.
 7. the page sleeping horse and pigs under the crinkly barn door. Chicks and sheep sleeping under a rough felt sack of oats and corn.
8. rough felt hay bales cover the resting cows.

The down side is it has Velcro. I hate anything with Velcro. I have to wash it separately otherwise... it sticks to the best thing in the wash. Maybe just my luck... but I hate it. The book would be awesome if it was snap shut book.",0
"Good value - but all of the locks are opposite.  So when they are in the ""unlocked"" position, they are vertical.  Most locks are turned vertically to be locked - not these.  It's confusing and a little annoying but they seem to be ok.  The door jam plates didn't line/up or work on 1/2 of our order of 10, so we just used the old ones for now.  One set that we used ended up failing after a month (locking mechanism didn't open/shut all the way and it became a nuisance - had to just uninstall it and now have to be replaced.

"Not bad!  Considering how much cheaper this cutter is that the ones at the big box stores (and even here on Amazon), this is a great value.  Made cuts just like it should.  Only reason for not getting five stars is that it's aesthetically rough... there's clearly no finish work done to this item once that stamp it out and assemble it at the plant... other than a quick, shabby paint job (which, for the record is orange, not yellow as in the picture)... but again, these are all issues with the way it looks, which I could care less about...

We use it on our sink and it's really easy to clean. It is a little pricey for a single pan, but it is a great product for the price.

It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with. There are two in the pack which is probably a good idea for first timers with screen protectors, but it would have been nice to be able to purchase a single for those of us with experience and established technique.",0

Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more.",0
"An enjoyable book to read, although I do disagree that Robb is the second coming of Ellis Peters.  Her plots are complicated just to be complicated and some of her ""good"" characters are unlovably sticky.  Her insistence on the occasional arcane vocabulary seems arbitrary and pettifogging -- especially since perfectly good modern English words are available for most of them.  (After all, her dialogue is actually a ""translation"" of the Chaucerian language they spoke in, anyway.)  Nevertheless, Robb is a good writer and constructor and the book is a romp to read.  Better start the soap opera here, by the way -- she won't catch you up later in the series if you miss an episode.",0

It also examines the desperate tactics of an embittered old man willing to destroy  lives to get his
own way.

"Signed up for SterlingPro's Private Class. The quality is good, it's simple to assemble and fits the other two.  The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love it. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want",1
Really enjoyed this book. It was awesome. Two people who lost and found each other. They had their troubles but could not overcome their feelings. So glad they found each other. They fit. Loved and lost but to only find love again,0
"These are PERFECT for anywhere.  I have bought many more of these around the house.  They are a great value.  I am using them in the kitchen, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in the hallway, in the dining room, in the closet, etc.  I love them.  They look great and are easy to use.  I have had them installed in about a year.  I highly recommend these to anyone who needs one.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value.I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a little kid, but it does look nice on my wall. It's well made and the only thing that",1

"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever.",0
I drink a lot of cocktails and like to have the drink chilled. If you freeze the glass it has a large glass base that helps with keeping the cocktail chilled. The price is a bit high but it works.,0
"We were a little hesitant to order the case because it was a lot thinner than the other one.

I had to replace the case with the new one, so it is a nice surprise.

The case is a bit thicker than the original one, but it is not the same thickness.

The case is also a bit thicker than the original one, but it is not the same thickness as the original case.

It is very well made, and does not come with a backlit keyboard, so you will have to get used to that.

I highly recommend it if you are looking for a case that is thicker than the original one.This is a great product",1
"Straps are sturdy and will last a long time.  I will keep my belt in the pocket.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for his golf swing since he was a kid.  It is a great pump for the money.  He's also going to use it for a lot of other uses as well.",1
"This book kept me reading. There are different definitions of 'lost' that are embodied in all the characters, and this, combined with intertwined mysteries, kept me engaged. Also enjoyed the device of alternating current day with past events.",0
"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design.",0

Bought this for my niece and she loves it!  It is easy to use and does not take up much room.,1
use these with mom in the bath and she loves them.  She also loves the baby dolls.,1
"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past.",0

Such a great product and good price. Easy to travel with.,0
This outfit is so well made and the quality is just right.  The only reason I ordered this is because I had to get a size down and the waist was too short,1

"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.",0
Very cute and fun. I would recommend it.We love this toy. My 2 year old has been,1
"Leonardo was a great buy! We have the Brio and Tamiya G1, the Clipper and the Mustang. The G1 is a bit bigger than the G1, but that's not a huge deal. I would buy it again if I could.

They are a better quality than the original.  The two buttons are also a little easier to use. ,1

"Zombicide features 71 28mm miniatures (Cobalt, Burgh, Gorgon, Cloth, Ironhide, Skaven, Serpent, and Anteater) and a 4 piece kit with a five piece kit.

I was excited to see how this set would fare in the hands of a family with three children. I'm very happy with the quality of this set. I wish I had known about the original Munchkin.

The box itself is very well made and very sturdy. It's the perfect size for any LEGO fan. The colors are bright and vibrant and the pieces are sturdy. The pieces are well-made and not just one piece. They're very easy to assemble and stay together. It's a very durable set.

There's a nice amount of variety in the pieces. The pieces are sturdy and have a good amount of room to go around. There are some really cool things in there.

My only complaint is that the markers are small. They seem to be about the size of a quarter. I don't know if this is a problem with the markers or if the markers are too small. But I can't say for sure.

The kit comes with a nice set of four pieces. There are two sets of matching markers.

The kit includes a matching set of 10 pieces.

It comes with a set of 20 pieces.

There are a few other parts in the kit, but they all come with the same theme.

I like that the pieces are well made and that the pieces fit together.

The kit is well made and well built. It comes with a set of 5 pieces.

So naturally, all the other characters we have to order online. Every time we think we have them all, they come out with new characters or variations of the main characters. Luckily, we have all the main characters now. These are not cheap knock off versions of the Nick Jr characters, they are the same ones you find at toy stores or big box stores. They are heavy duty, well made die cast trucks that have held up to my three year olds heavy playing and smashing them together and off of other things.",0

"Great product at first, but degrades over time.  This product is super easy to install.  It's literally plug and play.  The speeds it provides is meh.  I have a 75MBPS connection but only about 30MBPS gets through on this adapter.  Other powerline adapters keep me on much higher speeds.  After a few months, the adapter would lose connection for about a minute every so often.  As more time went by, it'd get worst and worst eventually leading me to abandon it all together.

"I really tried to like this series. I've read, well quickly skimmed through all the books so far. I won't continue to read anymore. I really felt the story as a whole was just incredibly boring and instead of smart, courageous women we get bratty, careless teenage girls trying to rebel. The dialogue did not reflect adult conversations at all. Plus all 3 books are boring, the thing is these could really be great stories if some effort was put into it. Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author needs to write adult women into the roles not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girls at that.

It not only brings an entirely new ergonomics to the camera (for the better) but adds several more controls enhancing it's professional use to say the least. But build is like Fort Knox perfection. NO gaps and it's solid as a rock once installed. I prefer to use the battery access on the grip altogether than bother with removal to install in the main body.

"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try.",0

Chiweenie well except it is a little long on her back extending down over the base of her tail. This will not be a problem as I just tuck it under a little when she wears it outdoors and it stays tucked.  The extra length will be nice to keep her warmer when she wears this for other purposes.  I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.

My son is 4 and has had this for about a month now and it's been a hit! He loves it!Great, very well made, I ordered this for my son's 3rd birthday. He absolutely loved it! He was able to control his voice and it is quite loud and it's a great gift for a kid who loves to play with the phone. But he did have to be a little careful not to get it in the wrong hands. He also had to take it out and put it in the water. He has never had any issues with it. He's now 3 months and he's",1
"Eric's obsession with movies takes a back seat to the fact that he's also a serial killer, and is basically living the dream.

In the end, the movie is okay, but it's a little disappointing in some ways. The movie is a little slow to get going, but the story is pretty good, and it's a pretty good ending. I think the ending could have been a little more interesting, but I think that's a minor complaint.

Overall, if you like this type of movie, you'll probably like this one.  I recommend it.I enjoyed this movie and am glad I bought it.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this series.  However, if you like the story, you will enjoy it.  It has a good story, but it is not as good as the other ""Home Movies"" on the list.  I have seen some of the movies that are on this list that I am not sure what the reason for the rating is.  For example, ""The World's End"" was a good movie, but ""The Fog"" was a little better.  I would have liked to have seen a different ending, but I found it a little too slow.  I don't know.

"Sunset Hill by Everett Powers is a thriller novel featuring a California police officer named Grant Starr.  In Sunset Hill the Sunset Hill killer is back despite the fact that they had a woman in jail that had confessed to prior crimes.  This is the third book in the Grant Starr series and the first one that I have read.

Sunset Hill opens with our killer picking up a newly divorced man at a local bar as she gives the reader a peak into her strategy for choosing her targets.  Between the murder mystery aspect of the book and the social interactions that occur between Grant and the other main characters the plot moves quickly and with great interest.

Having not read the other books in the Grant Starr series did not seem to detract from my understanding of the plot and enjoyment of the book.  That said, I typically like to read books in order so when I pick up my next Everett Powers novel it will be the first Grant Starr novel so that I can get the benefit of watching the characters develop.",0

I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read about animals and a good way to have fun. I really enjoyed reading this book.,1

"When this was a lightning deal recently, I couldn't resist getting this for my grandchildren.  I remember playing game after game of Connect Four with my kids when they were young.  I even played it a lot with one daughter when she had to be under a mist tent in the hospital.  It's the only thing that wouldn't fall apart!  Those memories flooded back when one of these big versions was in the waiting room at Texas Children's Hospital.  My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.

The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them.",0

I think most people know or have known women like Odette, Clarice, and Barbara Jean.  The bond among the women was amazing & it kept them strong.  Mr. Moore has great insight into their lives & wrote a delightful story . His family must be lots of fun to give him such good story material.

"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.

My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).

For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.

I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.

Overall, consider the cost and what you want out of a guitar- if it is just fun and goofing around with a little intro to the instrument- this one might suit you; otherwise, buy a better one.",0

"This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect ""huggable"" size for my 1 year old.  The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails or a play yard - at least according to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy.",0

"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.",0

"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

"This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run.",0

"I really am impressed with this textbook.  It is one of the most organized texts I have ever used in college.  The authors and publisher do an excellent job of ""formatting"" the topics.  All equations are very well marked and numbered.  Many other texts throw an equation in the middle of a paragraph and you can never find it when you need it.  Not so in this book!  You will always find just what you are looking for.

They also do a great job of explaining the topics, with many many examples in each chapter.  They provide ""quick quizzes"" in each chapter with answers at the end of the chapter that allows you to see how you are doing.  They make liberal use of colors and illustrations which all help to ease the strain on the eye, and help the mind follow along.

Overall, VERY GOOD BOOK!  This book will never leave my library reference collection.",0

"My boys (ages 10 and 13) love the swimming pool.  We also have a large pool.  The pool is open to the outside and is easy to clean.  The pool is comfortable and well ventilated.  We have used it for swimming and swimming pool play.  It is a great place to have the pool and hang out.  It is a great pool for adults and children.  The pool is nice and spacious.  I like that the pool is easy to clean.  I do wish the pool had a little extra room for our small children to sit on and play.  They like that it is easy to clean and not have to clean up the pool.

I'm 5'11"" and 140lbs and the pool is a good size for me.  I don't have to worry about the pool getting dirty.  The pool is pretty small, but not too big.  I will probably get a little more room in the pool.  The pool is very good quality, but not very large.  I would definitely buy this again.

"For an action figure like this, where the ""main attraction"" revolves around the use of the blaster in his hand, I feel it does not meet the build quality in comparison to the rest of the toy.

The toy itself is detailed, and is sturdy enough for a 3 year old to have many hours of fun with. The blaster? Not so much. It stopped serving it's purpose within about 2 weeks.

Overall, the toy is not a bad purchase by any means, and pretty much becomes an essential action figure once your child sees Toy Story 2 for the first time, but if you do purchase, just be aware that the blaster is flimsy.",0

Oh, and there's some really pretty scenery and some fancy fishing.
To enjoy this movie, you have to be prepared to sit back, relax, and be receptive to a slow unfolding of the story's subleties. A little bit like the way people enjoy fishing, come to think of it.

"Elsa Quinn has been bullied her whole life, not just the kids at school but her mothers constant harping on weight loss has finally reached a boiling point.  Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Elsa joins a gym preparing to exercise the weight off.

Noah Stewart drives to another town to workout, as a football jock at school he gets inundated with his friends wanting to hang out while at the gym and he just wants to focus on working out.  When he sees Elsa, he wants to know why she is there, sure he has seen her at school but he wonders if she will tell people he is here.  Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.

I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read.",0

"What I liked:  Alice in Zombieland is about a girl that finds out that her father wasn't really simply a mental case when he locked the family in at night to protect them from terrible creatures.  The monsters are real, and they're coming, and they will eat you.  Ali is reeling from the tragedy of losing her entire family while adjusting to her new reality where zombies exist and she can now see them.  Teaming up with others at her school, she must fight to prove that she's worthy of sharing their secrets and fighting the good fight.

What I didn't like:  The zombies in Alice in Zombieland are not zombies, but rather some type of soul-eating spirit monsters.  There is little of Alice in Wonderland to be found in this book.  At the beginning, I was under the impression that there would be more, but it quickly devolves to only tangentially related chapter titles and a main character with the same name.  Given that zombies and Alice in Wonderland are the two main reasons I picked the title up, it was a bit of a recipe for disappointment for me.  Also, the insta-love with Cole Holland was ridiculous.  Even though Showalter tried to explain it away with some sort of magical something or another, it turned me off their relationship for a big chunk of the novel.

Final thoughts:  Alice in Zombieland can be enjoyable, if you know what to expect.  Don't come in expecting a retelling of Alice in Wonderland in any form, nor true zombies.  Be prepared for the ridiculously executed insta-love and some heavy melodrama.  If you can handle these things and enjoy the characters, you can find in this novel a quite different take on the teens fighting evil theme.  I'll likely continue the series.",0

The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...",0

"Christmas at Waratah Bay is a wonderful beautifully written holiday story. I loved the Australian setting as the background, feeling as if I was flying back with Sarah to spend one last Christmas there with Grandfather figure, Harold. Much to admire about Sarah, though maybe not her cooking skills, which last there of only served to make her more endearing. Her true strength of character shows through as she tries her best for Harold and then Max. Speaking of which, Max is a true friend to Harold but hard to like at first.

It is the differences in the characters with the wariness that acts as a catalyst that leads to their dealing with past issues in their lives. Love and family is always worth the work as Sarah and Max discover. Of course, a little Christmas magic never hurts either. A valuable lesson to be learned. Delightful read. One of my favorites of this series.

"I love Andy Garcia but this movie is just too much of a boring, slow, slow movie.

I had to watch it again and again to understand the significance of it all.

The movie is in English so it was a little long and I wasn't able to understand the subtitles.

The acting was decent but the plot was just too simplistic.

"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

Skylar packs her bags and move to Atlanta and meet Rusty, who is a member of the Devil Kings MC and arival club and sworn enemies of the Evil Dead MC.. Skylar finds Rusty murdered in his own bed with her knife and all evidences clearly makes Skylar appear to be guilty therefore; she becomes a target for the Devil Kings MC.The author did an exceptional job with this novel and I love it. I connected very easily with the main characters. I found this book to be fast paced and really enjoyed the scenes between the two of them as they got more and more involved with each other as well as handling difficult situations.

I had a pair of Denon earbuds before, and I wanted to go back and purchase them.

I have to confess I bought this book for my 4 yr. old daughter and ended up keeping it for myself! It's still in the family so I think it's okay--besides I think she's a bit young for it! I bought it because I thought it would be inspirational for my young daughter and as I started reading through it I found it inspiring myself. I love the way the artist's talk about their experiences with art. I also enjoyed looking at the art they created when they were young. Many of the artists also give bits of inspiring words for the young artists to think about. I think this book would be a wonderful gift for a young inspiring artist or anyone who enjoys art!,0

"Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved.",0

"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

The plot was creative and interesting and while I DID guess some of the outcomes, the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away! I was NOT expecting that one and that's one of the things I love in a movie. Movies should be entertaining, have a good plot, have good actors (even if they're not well known), good direction and keep you interested from the first frame to the last and sometimes even give the viewer a great surprise they weren't expecting at all. This movie did all of that. I'd definitely recommend it and think it's worth both your time and your money.",0

"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.

If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!

Some advice on the price:
-This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check!
-Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills.",0

I enjoyed the writing and the characters. I liked the way the characters kept their personalities to themselves and their relationships. I loved the fact that the author does not give up on the story and how it is told. I also liked how the author does not give up on the book. I love how this author does not allow the reader to feel lost in the characters.

"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue.",0

Kail is intrigued by the mysterious Penelope, and she immediately does what she can to try and stop the bad guy from killing her.  She goes to the local police department to talk to them about the Penelope, but she isn't given any other information.

"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.

There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?

At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.

The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.

If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

"I bought the Inferno somewhat reluctantly because of all the negative reviews.  But since I have loved all of Brown's previous books, it seemed worth a chance. I am an avid reader of nonfiction - have a library of thousands - and occasionally read fiction recreationally. Brown is one of the few fiction writers that I enjoy, because he so elequently sets the scene of his stories, and describes the locations in great depth. These are usually places that I will never see, but definitely would have, if the circumstances of my life had been different. It seems that this has been a problem for many reviewers, but for me, it is one of the many reasons that Brown's books never fail to enchant me.

The next issue that appears to have bothered some reviewers was the topic of overpopulation.  This has been addressed often by scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, among others, and yet I don't hear it discussed among the general population as more than a passing topic. It is as though the subject is of no concern to most people. But to make it the subject of a novel, by such a renowned writer, people will become more aware, and perhaps even research the issue... and who knows...  even do something about it.

That was what I experienced when The DaVinci Code was on the best seller lists. Everywhere I went people were talking about it. Some were appalled by the ideas Brown put forth, but many were fascinated by the ideas and were researching the early Christian era to find out more about it.

I have always had an interest in the Divine Comedy, and so, really appreciated reading a novel that featured it so highly. Also, Brown certainly had me on the edge of my seat with all the dramatic chase scenes and all the unknowns such as his amnesia.

All in all, I have to say that I loved the book and will probably read it again, as well as recommend itto others.",0

"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good book.

The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!"" And then she eats the lima beans and everything is fixed. Ugh. The message is so obtrusive.

"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart.",0

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books.",0

"""It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it""

The story of the prodigal son is one of the most prominent parables Jesus tells in the Gospels. A young man rejects his father, takes his inheritance, and foolishly spends it. The son finally decides to return home hoping that his father will forgive him and accept him back as servant. Unexpectedly the father doesn't even wait for an apology. The father runs out to his son and throws him a huge banquet.

This parable is both comforting and infuriating. It's comforting to see the unconditional love of the father, yet infuriating that the father doesn't ask for an apology or make him work back his favor.

A lot of Christians today live in this paradox. They love the unconditional love of God but are irritated when God shows so much love and mercy towards our enemies. We even do not like to accept undeserved grace. Legalism is born from this idea that we must earn back God's favor and fortune. ""One of the greatest challenges of the spiritual life is to receive God's forgiveness."" Our hearts need not to be focused on searching for God or loving God more. We need to allow God to love us.

Nouwen spins the parable a bit in this book. We always look at where fit between the sons: are we the lost son that returns or the stubborn brother that doesn't love? Nouwen challenges us to think about the father. Yes, in the parable the role of the father is the Lord, but God commands us to be like Him. Are you capable of loving like the father? Accepting and forgiving without an apology?",0

"I guess they're...okay? For the price, maybe they're not so bad. What drives me crazy is that there is no ""disconnect"" button. When you turn on, it automatically connects to the last paired device. So if I want to connect to my kid's device, but my phone is turned on and it was connected to my phone previously, I can't make it disconnect. I have to go to my phone and turn off Bluetooth before it will allow connection anywhere else.

I'd love to be wrong about this and will change my review if so, but it seems it just can't be made to disconnect.

As for audio, they sound like low end headphones. Better than earbuds, but nothing of note. The ear area is a touch small so if you're an adult, they might feel squishy.",0

Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up.",0

I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time,",1

"Not bad for the price.
The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad.",0

"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet.",0
So I finally got around to it and bought the third one.  This one is a bit larger and more sturdy.  I am using it with the TRS-80 and it is still working well.

"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent for the price!

"Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy. As charming and quirky as Gail Carrigers Soulless series, CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES delves back into all the ways that society, science, and magic can collide. Sophronias perspective on manners and intelligence gathering is a fantastic window into this world, which is as interesting for the social dynamics as for the dirigibles and mechanimals. From the outside, placing a spy training facility inside a Victorian finishing school would seem like an odd juxtaposition, but even new readers will quickly orient themselves to this mix of familiar historical setting and completely original world building. Sophronoia reads as a genuine teenager (though historical gloss makes her seem older than her 14 years), and her youth is a key element of what makes her compelling as a heroine. The choices that face her are relatable, from budding love to jealous rivals, and each one of these challenges foreshadows larger life issues she will face one day. As a lady intelligencer, Sophronia is learning how to blend with society, but will she also internalize the limitations and boundaries of the peers around her? Will she submerse herself in the cold, calculated, ignore-the-collateral-damage world of intelligence gathering? Or will she find a new path for herself, both professional and empathetic?

While the intricacies of the mystery in CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES kept me glued to the page, it will be that larger question of Sophronias fate that will keep me coming back for more. Witty, charming, and brimming with potential, I cant wait to see the woman Sophronia is growing into.",0

"I really like this bag. I'm a woman, and was looking for a small, lightweight messenger style bag that would fit my wallet, keys, phone & other small necessities as well as my iPad, pencil, battery charger, cords... Etc. I wanted something sturdy, simple and well designed, but that appealed to my style. This bag met all my requirements and I've been really impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. I'm surprised at how roomy it is for what I feel is a smaller bag - even loaded up with all my stuff, I've always had room to spare.
During shipping, the box was slightly damaged and the bottom front corner of the bag was dented when I unpacked it. I decided to keep it, hoping with use it would work itself out with use, but it didn't and the dent remains. It adds character... That's what I'm going with :)
The only other thing I would wish for is an extra metal slide or something to keep the loops of the long strap together. When I shorten the strap, the strap doubles across itself and doesn't function well as a single strap when I go to grab it quickly... Just a minor thing really.
Great bag, great functionality, looks awesome, quality seems like it will outlast me!",0

"These are nice clippers. I'm not a professional, but shave my dog down regularly, and have tried  a number of different products. These clippers are fine, and they work nicely. What I'm not so sure about is the price. I'd suggest two other options:

For professional use, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oster-A5-Turbo-2-Speed-Professional-Animal-Clipper/dp/B000LRN31A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper</a>&nbsp;has been the gold standard for grooming professionals for decades. And since it sells for less than these, I'd select that first for professional usage.

For home use, I don't really notice any difference between this one and my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andis-EasyClip-Pro-Animal-7-Piece-Detachable-Blade-Clipper-Kit-Pet-Grooming-MBG-2-22690/dp/B00UT3F31O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andis EasyClip Pro-Animal 7-Piece Detachable Blade Clipper Kit, Pet Grooming, MBG-2 (22690)</a>. It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4). If you want to use combs with this one, you'll pay more for something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Stainless-Steel-Guide-Combs-3390-100/dp/B002RBWL1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wahl Professional Animal Stainless Steel Guide Combs #3390-100</a>, which I'm sure is nice... but it's not included.

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

Anyway, this is a good clipper... but wouldn't be my first choice for the price.",0
"I consider the Competition Electronics ProChrono to be the industry standard for general purpose ballistic speed measurements.  There are other, fancier, and more costly options - but this chrono will get the job done accurately and reliably time after time for a reasonable price.

The unit stores several strings of fire, each holding a large possible number of shots.  When reviewing the string, each shot can be reviewed, in addition to specified ""Lo"", ""Hi"", and ""Avg"".

A reliable chronograph is essential if you are a reloader.  Bullet velocity is one of the most crucial metrics to use when perfecting your recipe for perfection!  Also, if you compete in shooting sports, such as IDPA, you will need to know that your ammunition meets the minimum requirements.

Competition Electronics is one of the most trusted names in the shooting sports, making other standard tools such as shot timers (if you've ever been to a shooting match, you have probably seen them in use).  I trust the brand because their equipment works!",0

The instructions are very different. This toy is a lot of fun. I like that the toy is made from recycled materials, so it's not hard to find. This toy is actually great!  We have been using it for a few weeks now, and it's not only holding up well, it's holding up well. I would recommend it for any Star Wars fan. My daughter loves it. My 3 year old loves it. I have no complaints about this product. It's just not what I expected. My kids have been using this as a playhouse for a long time. We have had it for hours.

"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate. I would personally remove those questions before passing it to my teenager when he has his friends over. The game comes with everything you'll need such as a dry erase board and pen for writing the five candidates down, 1-2 point chips for betting and spinners for selecting your own vote.",0

"This version of Risk has you fighting for control of middle earth.  There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.  The this version of risk adds in generals, strongholds and the fellowship of the ring movie along to Mount Doom; all of these can be optional of course.  Generals and strongholds add one to the players highest roll, so if you are defender being attacked and you territory has a stronghold in it then your 6 becomes a 7.  If you are an attacker and have a general in the territory you are attacking from then your 6 becomes a 7.  Now the playing with the fellowship of the ring then they begin in Shire and move you terroritory per turn till they reach Mount Doom.  If the fellowship lands in a terroritory controled by the forces of Mordor then they can roll to capture the fellowship and thus win the game, but if the fellowship reaches Mount Doom then the forces of Mordor loose.  Beyond these additions this game play like normal Risk.  Overall this a fun version of Risk and if you love both Risk and LOTR then this is a must buy.",0

"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy.",0

"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand I'm sure it will stay with me, if only because it has provided me with a vivid picture of what the mental life of somebody I know may be like. On the other hand I did not care for the writing ...

... starting with the title, whose intriguing promise is not in any way, that I can see, kept, Naturally the title brings to mind Sherlock Holmes. And the connection is indeed drawn in the book, which, very annoyingly to my mind, relates the main plot of the relevant Conan Doyle novel, which I would have been motivated to reread after all these years had it only been alluded to rather than completely revealed (and to no good purpose that I can see). And what does it have to do with THIS novel? Not much. Just about the only plot element that was keeping me interested was the detective mystery, but, bizarrely, this is blown up rather early in the game ... admittedly thereby introducing a different and also intriguing plot element, but not intriguing enough to assuage my disappointment at the demise of the detective element.

The writing is lacking also in that there are contradictions in the text and sometimes the characters do things that I simply could not believe.

The main problem with the writing, though, is one of the things that gives the book its strength, namely, conveying what I presume is an autistic-like mind. Unfortunately the author is not enough of a stylist to prevent me from mentally shouting, OK, enough already, I get it. It became tedious for most of my read.

I will credit the book and story with a strong double message: It shows that some people are capable of unconditional love (and some are not), and happiness is not to be found.",0

"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp.",0

Loved all the language and the landscapes, and I totally bought into the people surrounding this wonderful horse. My one very small issue came at the end, where the author seemed to be compressing rather than extending the tail (no pun intended!) of the story.

"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher.",0

"This doorbell easily installed on my chain link gate with the included sticky pad.  I placed the ringer on a plastic board and fastened the board against the fence.  Most of the rings are digital music.  There are eight ""ring"" options on this doorbell which was sufficient for our needs.  The second loudest setting can be heard down the hallway through a closed door.

Waterproofing is as advertised. I frequently water my bushes with the gate open, and the ringer gets drenched.  It's also held up well in the southern California sun, with the battery lasting over 8 months already.  You will have to unscrew the circuit board to get to the battery, which is going to be a pain when the battery needs replacement.

It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing.",0

"I read this the first time so many years ago, that I do have to admit I had forgotten so much about the many side stories and characters. Why that should take away from a novel for some readers is beyond me, but everyone has their favorites. I would only say, so many stories in books and movies these days are so pat. I always tease my wife for rushing through her novels, and she's always teasing me for insisting on reading every. single. word, and doing so at a pace I think the author may appreciate. If a book's an easy read, I'll motor through it in a couple hours, but a more dense novel filled with beautiful writing, well, I'll happily go at a tortoise's pace. I bring this up to say, this novel stuck with me for so many years for a reason. Why let yourself get frustrated if the author chooses to take his time? I read this as a child and over the years have loved apocalyptic stories. Some of the more recent blockbuster movies in the genre have greatly disappointed. Lucifer's Hammer was brilliant in that it showed how so many outstanding plans, crafted by sharp people, dedicated to detail, can all fall to, well, you'll see. The guy made homemade beef jerky, stocked his jeep with all the necessary gear, and backup gear of the most important stuff, and was absolutely prepared for the coming disaster.",0

"I tried this on recommendation from Bob O-Brian of Luthier Mercantile International. ( LMI)  It works exactly as advertised for filling grain, especially in fine hardwoods like those used in guitar building or refinishing. Dries fast and clear. Sands easily. Very little odor. Non toxic. Water based. Builds fast but is not a heavy tone-killing finish so it is great for acoustic or semi acoustic instruments. Remember to do small sections, because it dries fast. Other than that small caution, I can wholehearted recommend this water based finish. You can see a good demonstration video here:

"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.

Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.

Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!",0
All I can say is that this book was very good.  I enjoyed it very much and am looking forward to the next book in the series.  I think this is a great book to read.

"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while.

But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended periods because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the reviews and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot...

Sturdiness: I real the instructions and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animals can get around that ... oh well.

Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It was easy. To test it, I put 5 cups in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding.

Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes releases 1/4 less the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time.

Sound: I was testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard was the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all.

I am going to set the other one up and test them a few times and I'll update my review. So far so good...

Update: So I've had it a couple days now and it is dispensing what it says it will. Again, the only it makes is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase.",0
"Just started taking yoga at our company-offered class.  All new props were purchased for this class and all items--8' straps, bolsters, blocks, mats, and blankets--were Hugger Mugger brand.  The instructor said this brand was always good quality.  For my home practice I also got this blanket.  It is soft yet sturdy, has that broken-in look that I didn't mind throwing on the floor, and I can fold it just like in class.  It washed up nice too.  Kinda wanted to pick a color, but I received the black/gray one and I LOVE it.  I never would have picked it but it really looks great!  Also, when I purchased this same blanket mid September it was $24.99.",0

The feet are adjustable so that you can level the unit so it won't wobble.

"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",0

"My daughter - 2.5 years old - loves new toys and is usually a big fan of ones that interact with her.  She was not terribly impressed with this doll and neither was I.  The biggest feature of this doll is supposed to be that it giggles and laughs when you bounce and spin her.  In reality, you have to get very forceful (borderline abusive) in order to get her to ""react.""  I was concerned by the level of force my toddler needed to use to get a reaction, and I did not in any way want to encourage that level of forceful activity with her toys, especially considering that we are adding a new baby to the family soon.

Baby Alive went to the back of the closet and there have been no requests for her return as of yet.  We will probably simply remove her batteries and reintroduce her as ""just"" a cuddly baby doll.",0

"This book is so, so good.  I wish I had known about this series before, but I will definitely being going back to catch up on all the books I have missed.

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

"I've been a Dune fan since I saw the movie. I read it for a reason and it was a great movie. The movie is a good movie, but not a great movie. The book is a little slow in the pace, but it's a good book.The author does a great job of explaining how to create and use non-fiction workbooks.  He has great examples for use in non-fiction writing.  The book is a great reference for anyone interested in learning about the history of the English language.  I highly recommend this book.I was just rereading this book after reading the book that I was reading from the library. I found it to be a very interesting book and I was a bit disappointed. It is a story about a man who had a baby, a woman who had a child, a man who had a wife, and a woman who had a son. I found that the characters in the book were very interesting and the story was interesting and interesting and there were a lot of twists and turns. I felt that the book was written well and I felt like I knew the story and the characters and was very interested in the story. I would have liked to have read more about this man's life, but I found it rather boring and not very interesting.

We begin with a first person narration of the story.

I had to say, ""Okay, I'm not going to say it's a spoiler, but it's a spoiler, and it's going to be a spoiler.""

I was looking forward to reading the book, but I just didn't think I was going to get it. It was so predictable, I actually had to get it back.

But, I was very happy with the ending, and I will definitely be reading more of this book!

You'll be able to read this book at your leisure, and you won't be disappointed. I'm glad I gave it to a friend.I loved this book. It was an awesome read and I was really excited to see the movie.

Although a bit more gratuitous violence than I like, I would consider the content to be tame by modern ""Over The Top"" action movies.  This is a movie that gets you to think and watch it again.

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this.",0

"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.  I will use it more as specialty equipment for baking something very sticky like Florentines but continue to use my traditional cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper for most of my baking.",0

"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

"it fits 3/8"" and comes with an easy to carry pouch.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the design.  The ring is not solid, it's a bit bent and it's not clear how it will bend.  This is a problem for most people and a problem for others.  I also don't think the ring is a solid enough ring.  I would buy another ring to replace it if I needed one.

The price was great for this item.  You can buy it for $100 and it will last you a long time.  The price is a good price for what it is.  I'm not a big fan of the price and I don't",1
This is a perfect little swing. We hung it up in our front yard in a little tree and my 6 and 4 year old have not left it alone. I have not seen one flaw with this swing. We plan on keeping it in our travel trailer for camping all summer. Very very pleased with this swing. I did receive it at a discounted rate in return for my review but I really do love it.,0

"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.

Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.

Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!",0
"I purchased the original toys and it was a long time since I have ever had a toy that was so hard to find. I am so glad I purchased this one. The toys are so durable and well made. I have a 3 pound dog and he loves to tug on them. I love that they are held together and it has a very soft feel to it. It has also been very easy to clean and I highly recommend it to any dog owner! It's very easy to clean and holds up well for a long time. I highly recommend this toy!

I have a 15 pound Yorkie and it is a very durable toy. I can't say enough about how durable it is for him and the amount of ""thick"" I can hold it.

"Jeff Dunham world tour special All Over The Map I watch with an open mind based on what people said about the product.  For me personally I found his special to be enjoyable, lots of good facts about all the places the tour took place.  I also found all the characters were very funny in all the countries even when the rules were very strict about certain things said on stage.  The DVD does give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored specials is five out of seven specials which I now own this one.  I normally do give away any spoilers about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version has walter dropping alot of F words on stage during the preformance.  But like said before the special is actually very good if you watch with an open mind and enjoy all the extra's of how they flim it which is what alot of people complain about.  I didn't find it to be an issue at all with the special still funny and made me almost cry from laughing so hard rib cage still hurts today.",0

"Oh no the hell she didn't! I read the first book, Continental Divide, and was devastated by the ending. I wanted Jamie and Remington to get their happily ever after. I craved it. But, no. Laura Harner wouldn't let me have that. Instead she had them walk away from each other. Two years later we find that each of them is with someone new. I instantly hated the new partners because Remy was meant to be with Jamie. I pictured their demise in horrible, awful ways. My heart and head both hurt. I didn't want to like them. I refused. Then it happened. I actually fell in love with the new guys and couldn't see them being separated. Now I'm confused. This is book two of four. I have no idea where it will end, and believe me, I begged Ms. Harner to give me SOME clue, but she's remaining tight-lipped over the whole thing. So read this book, fall in love with some great characters, and delve into a mystery of sex, diamonds, and betrayal. I honestly didn't see this coming. My jaw dropped and I was screaming at my Nook (I do that on occasion, don't judge me!) Oh no the hell she didn't (again!). The author has said that this is going to be a four book series. I'm not sure how it's going to end, but I know that whatever path she takes, someone will be unhappy. I'm not sure who it will be, but I don't envy the author. She's remaining true to her characters and the vision she has laid out. I'm eager to see how it works out, even though I know it's going to cost me a piece of my heart when it's done.

"I am a big fan of books on the history of science and technology. This book is a valuable addition to my collection.

In this book, the author makes a good argument for the screwdriver being the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. It seems like such a simple invention, yet he demonstrates via good research the importance and discovery of the screwdriver. He makes a less-well researched claim to the history of the screw.

Many tools that we commonly use are much more ancient than the last millennium-the hammer, axe, plane, and so forth are ancient tools, well developed in Roman times. Yet the screw and screwdriver, essential today, are fairly new, developed during the late middle ages or early renaissance periods.

One of the best parts of the book is chapter 5, where not only reveals the 'first' screwdriver, but information on Henry Maudslay, Jesse Ramsden. Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, Richard Roberts, and James Nasmyth, most of whom I had never heard of before. Maudslay and this small group of mechanical geniuses were the people who 'invented precision' as another writer put it. In other words, this group devised the machine tools required for precision work. They are mentioned in this book because a lot of their work revolved precision screws, their use and manufacture.

That's one of the things that I like about this kind of history. One good book can lead to an area of discovery and knowledge that the reader might not know about. Since reading this book, I have become interested in the history of machine tools and their inventors.

A good book, well written. Recommended.

"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed.",0

"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate.

Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like.
UPDATE: 11/17 have had this 2.5 yrs now, the finish is still nice, but the pull out doesn't always want to stay in place, which is a bit of a bummer, also the switch between stream and spray sticks.",0

"Needed something exactly like this!!  I love the feel and fit of this bag.  I'm 5'10"" and it fits perfectly.  The bag itself is a great size and fits nicely.  It's a good size for a backpack.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made well. I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid. The gun is well made and seems to be well made. The gun is very bright and bright. It's not bright, but the gun does have a very bright field of view. It's not the brightest gun I've ever owned, but it is quite bright and bright enough to be seen in the dark. I highly recommend this gun to anyone.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. He is 5'4"" and 5'10"" and weighs 165 pounds. I ordered a size Large to fit him and it fit him perfectly.

"First of all.  The book has the same feel and feel of a detective story.  If you like detective stories, this is a must read.  If you don't, it's just not worth it.  I'm not going to give it away to anyone.

I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the young women who were on the train with a group of young men.  I wanted to know how the train crew would react when they saw the girls' faces.  I loved it and am glad I read it.  I read it every other week.  I had to buy it and was given the opportunity to read it again.  It's a beautiful story.  I wish I had the opportunity to read the whole book again.  I hope the next one is better.  I really enjoyed it.  It was good to see the girls get a little older and get back to life.  I'm glad I read it.  I would recommend it to everyone.Great book.  Keeps you interested.  Would recommend this to anyone with a high schooler.  I was looking for a book on the topic of old age and the benefits of age",1

"Should fiction writers use Roget's Thesaurus? I've read and heard arguments on both sides. Those who say ""No"" think that writers using It write overblown prose, using a long word where a shorter one would be better.
I disagree. There are times when the first word that comes to mind is the easy word that does not get at the real meaning of a character's thought, or the feeling I want to convey. If I just write, ""the room was cold,"" I've shortchanged the reader. How cold and why does the temperature matter?  But if I show that people wear two pairs of thick wool socks just to sit inside, or get up three times in the night to make sure the baby's bed cap is on his head, or have another character remark that the mercury has frozen in the thermometer, the reader feels the cold.

This thesaurus is not only a word-finder that lets me locate synonyms to vary my writing vocabulary, it jogs my brain into new was of thinking about what I'm writing.

This book lies on my desk waiting to help me write better. It must work, because I've won one Spur Award and been a finalist for another.",0
I purchased this pouch since it has the wide opening which is a nice feature for the size of the pouch. The pouch is also a bit small but the pouch is a great size and fits nicely. I would highly recommend this pouch to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews are accurate. I purchased this to replace the defective thumb caps I had on my old bike. They are awesome. I recommend them. I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house.,1
The one's we received had the green light button on the right not the left as pictured.  Which turns out is exactly what we wanted.  So the picture seems to be mirrored left to right.  Works great though.  If you plan on using several you might want to make a chart of how you set the four dip switches.  When I was testing my handy work I switched the light on and off several times than sat down to rest.  The light then began flashing on and off on its own.  I was confused until my son came upstairs and told me his light was turning on and off.  Only then I realized I set both to the same code accidentally so it was turning on and off both lights.,0
"Our son is almost 3 1/2, and I bought this set to see how well he liked Playmobil. It has been a great choice for a starter set! He loves adding other characters/toys (such as planes and construction vehicles) to the kit, and wants to get a mommy and daddy for the green dragon--so it's as great for creative play as my husband and I both remember from our childhoods. We also felt the quality of the plastic and construction was up to par with what we remember (hard to find these days). It was relatively easy to put together, and seems quite sturdy. I was surprised to see my kid did manage to pull one section apart since it seems really tightly put together once everything popped into place; but that's probably what helps to make it durable and resistant to breaking around younger kids too. Definitely looking forward to adding onto the collection over the next few years!",0

"The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.",0

"Overall, I like this vacuum.  I have an old one that I used for a couple of years.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would have made cleaning easier.  I also love the 2 filters that come with it.  I have a hard time getting the filter into the container when I have to use it to filter water.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after using it.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after it has been stored in a refrigerator or freezer.  I have a hard time getting it in the dishwasher.  I do like the color and the fact that it has a rubberized seal.  It is also a little heavier.  I don't have to worry about the metal being broken.  I like the fact that it has a plastic cover that makes cleaning easier.  I like the fact that it is a little bigger than my old vacuum.  I have been using it for several months now and it is doing a good job.  I am very happy with the purchase.Very nice and sturdy!

"I enjoyed the book enough to finish it. I have to say though that I thought the mystery wasn't a mystery to me at all. I won't ruin the surprise just that I figured it out long before it came out in the story. I do love the way Lee Childs writes his stories and the Jack Reacher character.

The only parts of the book I detested or thought it added little value to the book was the mother parts. I thought it got in the way of an interesting read. He also talks to his brother in this book but it doesnt add up to much. It was overly long and drawn out..it seems like half the book is about the mom. My only thought on this book is that could have been a lot shorter. The book really dragged on for me. Most of the Jack Reacher novels feature fist fights, guns and a mystery. Good stuff. This one sadly has the focus on the mother. Their are some fights and some gun play but most of it is just emotions. I also felt like the very last end was kind of cop out. I mean people could put 2 and 2 together and get 4 mighty easy and our hero does life in prison. My opinion only. Still I had fun reading it.",0

"My first Hakko was dead on arrival. When I turned it on, I got the error ""h-E"". After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine with very intermittent usage over the course of a few months. However, I needed to use the iron for a remote task recently. I put it in my toolbox along with some other tools. Upon reaching my destination and firing up the iron, I got the ""h-E"" message again!

I was left without the main tool I needed for the task on that Sunday. Left with few options, I went to Home Depot and picked up a cheap Weller. Lo and behold, the Weller got the job done, and the Hakko is out of commission again.

During the ~5 times that I was able to use the Hakko, I enjoyed its functionality. It just appears very delicate in my case. I wanted to love this well-respected iron, but I'm left with a dud yet again.",0

"Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.

Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read.",0

"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use.

"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.",0

"My 2yr old received this on her 1st b-day and she loved it. This was her first experience with using crayons in the tub, and it was a treat while it lasted. My biggest complaint is that the crayons ""shorten"" rather quickly so...as they shorten, the harder it is for little and big fingers to get out. It used to frustrate her so I stopped letting her use them. Now she uses the Dorothy fish bowl as a fun water strainer.

What a great main character for this story. I never give out spoilers or rehash the books description.  That said even though it's in the Heaven sent series, it's not related to any of the characters in book one.  This story stands on its own.  Micha too was such an essential part of the story I thought even though he wasn't one of the main characters. Enough said - go read it!",0

The socks themselves feel pretty good. I haven't worn them out yet (giving them a try this weekend) so I've left it at 4 stars until I get a chance to.

Update (5 stars):
I've just taken the socks out for an 11 mile hike across rocky terrain in 80F weather. The socks performed really well. They felt comfortable in my boots and were thick enough to keep any blisters forming. I was a bit apprehensive about wearing wool in summer, but I found that they did not feel too hot at all. On the contrary, they kept my feet pretty dry, especially compared to the cotton socks that I normally wear, which normally make my feet feel like they are swimming.

I've also given them a wash in the machine, and they don't seem to have shrunk.

All in all, I feel quite happy about this purchase. I've already recommended them to my hiking buddies.",0
"My fifth mora. There is no better Knife value than mora. Period. There may be some that are more survival oriented or that have a fancier steel Or sheath, but not better value. I got this one for camping food slicing and as a backup to my woodsy knife that literally cost more than 10x more. This has a 6 inch blade. I wanted stainless for food so I wouldn't have to put oil on it. The other reviews say the blade is 1/10 inch. Sounds right. It is a stiff blade with very little bend to it. Great grip with good palm swell and nice rubbery feel. Sheath is their usual plastic but more than adequate for any real life purpose.

 I thought about the model with the 8 inch blade but didn't really need one that long. And I don't see exactly what you would use that for that this one won't do better and that one would be cumbersome for some purposes.

I also have the mora companion, the 2000, and two of the robust models. All great knives. Highly recommended.",0

"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!",0

He's a huge Nerf fan and I ordered it to add to his Nerf collection. He loves to shoot it with it and it shoots great! It's very durable. The only thing I would say is the little plastic gun does not move and it isn't strong enough to get it to move. It is a bit annoying to shoot it at my son but it's ok. I like that it's a Nerf gun and he can shoot it at any time. It's a great toy!This is a very cool puzzle. My daughter loves it. I love that it is a little smaller than I thought it would be.

"This PWOW ErgoFit earbuds are very good for its price. It's very comfortable and have great sound quailty. One of the feature that I like about this earbuds because it block out background noise and wire cord are well made. For the price, I love it has built-in microphone to answer your calls, a switch to toggle between iPhone or android and a sliding volume control. It can only allow you to adjust music volume only so in order to skip it to next song which you need to do on your phone. Also, they don't hurt my ears after a long-wear. Earbuds and headphones that is more bulky tend to hurt my ears because they fit too full in my ears but this earbuds doesn't hurt my ears at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pair of earbuds that are really cheap with good sound quailty.

Pros:
* Ultra-soft ErogoFit in-ear earbuds
* Multipurpose Remote: Volume control, music switching, hands-free call, open Siri in iPhones
* Built-in microphone and answer key: allowing hands-free calling

Cons:
* None so far. But will update if anything

Paul is quiet and honorable, Georgina feels trapped by the rules imposed on her and does her best to flout them where she can  which contradicts her previous behavior, where shes been much more prim and proper. If you're looking for a quick read with some Regency flair  including a fun historical outing to see Madame Tussaud's waxworks  and like a bit of sensual heat, then this will likely fit the bill. Certain things were resolved a little too easily for my liking, but that might have been thanks to the short length. Overall its a nice read that unites a couple of minor characters from the series.

My crazy cats get litter everywhere even with the CatIT domed and covered litter box (which is the best box ever! Really helps to control odors!). I bought this pan mat to see if it would help.

Maybe they are doing it on purpose because they love to watch me sweep.  The mat is easy to clean and durable.,0

"This book's biggest accomplishment is reminding one what a great work of art Nabakov's masterpiece is.

My main problem with Tampa was that the main character did come across as a believable human being.  Whereas Humbert Humbert for all his deviant predilections was often a relateable  character, Celeste, the sexual-predator narrator and overwhelmingly dominant figure of Tampa, struck me as a one note, sex-addled sociopath; all the other characters in the book are too peripheral to engage much of the reader's attention.

Tampa is filled with detailed and uninteresting sex scenes.  The main interest is wondering how Celete's downfall will be brought about.  I hoped Celeste's ensuing public disgrace and trial to turn to a Bonfire of the Vanities type spectacle but that section of the book apparently occupied little of the author's attention because it sped by perfunctorily.

I was drawn to Tampa initially by enthusiastic reviews in credible sources such as Slate.  I wonder if much of this enthusiasm was the result of the phenomenon of male critics being automatically wowed and over impressed when female artists frankly address female sexuality (cf. Liz Phair).  Lisa Zeidner's review in the Washington Post (available online as of this writing) seemed a more accurate assessment of Tampa.

One may wonder why I gave Tampa even three stars.  First of all, I'm a generous grader when it comes to books.  Second of all, it did contains several humorous passages and passages of well wrought writing.  Third of all, despite its flaws, I'll remember it.  Lastly the author deserves some credit for daring the comparison to a canonical masterwork and inspiring one to reread its literary inspiration.",0

I don't no who don't know what the movie is about but it's kind of a slow,1
"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake.",0

"First let me start off and say I hate serial books. Totally hate them. However I did bite at Entwined for two reasons. One, it was free. Second, it was a Tarzan and Jane book. I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

Couldn't go wrong for a free purchase but the carrot that was dangled in front of my face at the end did not entice me to move on to the next book.",0

"I purchased a different kit than the one listed.  Mine had the Quick-Change adapter with 7 hex shank high-speed drill bits.  The drill bits are of excellent quality as is the click adapter.  All you have to do to insert a bit is push it in.  To remove it simply pull back on the padded collar of the adapter and the bit pops out.  Unlike Sears, Dewalt, Snapy and other quick adapters that I have used you do not have to pull back on the adapter and pull the bit out at the same time. The Bosch just pops it out.  What impressed me the most however was the lack of run out that the Bosh has.  The wobble that is present at the driver bit or drill bit tip that anyone who has ever used any sort of quick change hex shank adapter is much less noticeable with the Bosch than any I have ever used.  I am a solid surface/laminate fabricator and much of my time is spent installing counter tops and kitchen cabinets where a drill is indispensable for drilling as well as driving.  I have 3 of the Bosch Quick-Change adapters one in a Makita, one in a Dewalt, and one in a Metabo cordless drill.  I would not be without one of these Bosch adapters on the work site.  By the way I also use a Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver which is a pleasure to use and comes with a hex shank quick adapter mounted to the drill shaft instead of a chuck and it has more run-out than these Bosch adapters.",0

"The Nokia SU-8W Bluetooth keyboard (Cordless) is a great deal for the price.  The keyboard is small enough to fit most portable keyboards and the touchpad is great.  The only drawback is that the keys are slightly larger than standard keyboards.  The keys are also not as long as standard keys but I think it will be a problem for some people.  I also like the tactile feedback on the keys.  The ergonomics of the keyboard are very good.  The keys are also very easy to press.

"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

"Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.",0

"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!",0

"I haven't used this yet but I am anticipating I will in the next few weeks. We were giving some antelope skins by someone so we my young son could practicing tanning and maybe make some moccasins from the skin. The first thing we noticed was that there was a lot of 'meat' on the skin still.

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

I believe having this tool in hand will be very helpful. I'll try to update after we have used it on our hides.",0

He has great upper body strength and will pull up to a 40 degree.  He likes that he can carry around his phone or other items for emergencies.  He will use this as a pack, camping, or a carry-on.  He likes that it is a little bigger than my pack.  It is very warm and he is able to pack it up in the car with no worries.  I will be buying another one for my daughter.  I have no complaints about this.  We are both on our own and have not had any problems with the product.  Great product.Great buy. My wife and I have used it many times and it has held up to all of the abuse. The only thing I would say is that it will be a little more expensive for the same quality as the regular type of stuff.

"I wish there was a 3 1/2 star option.  I am somewhere between this book is ok and liking it.  Andre and Devon are wonderful characters with great chemistry when they are in the throws of passion.  But, on the other side of that Devon starts out strong and fearless then turns to ""Andre"" mush and then fearless again.  It isn't very consistant.  Then there is Andre, who is a super hot French captian, but is just a brute!!!  There are times he is a head strong man ready to dive in and save the day, and other times he is simply a donkey's butt!

The plot is a strong one, untill we get to the island, then it is rushed alittle.  That is when the story becomes ok for me.  The ending ties up all loose ends, but not very engaging.

The other charachters in this book (Minter, for one) are really great.  I was hoping the second book was about him.

So, basically there were somethings I didn't like about the book, but the bulk of the book was good.  There is some love scenes, so beware if you are looking for clean romance.  (They are tasteful as far as passion goes)

It was a free read from Kindle, and even if I had purchased it, I wouldn't have been disapointed.",0

"There is little doubt that Trevor is a master of his craft and perhaps the  greatest living short story writer in the world today.  After Rain, a  volume of twelve stories, explores such subjects as infidelity,  homosexuality, religious conflicts, and violence.  What makes these stories  so powerful, however, is not the subjects they deal with, but the portrayal  of the characters thoughts, emotions, and responses.  Trevor is able to  examine such human conditions as jealousy, rage, sadness, regret, and hope  in a non-judgmental light that leaves the reader looking into oneself to  gain further insight.  His writing style is nothing short of remarkable.  He is eloquent and simplistic, never revealing more than he should, making  the unspoken a compelling component of his story.  If you have not yet read  Trevor, I urge you to wait no longer.  His literary grace will surely leave  a lasting impact on you as a reader and as a human being.",0
"This is a nice compilation of recipes. The language is very stilted and would benefit greatly from a proofreading by an American speaking person, if that is the target audience the author is trying to reach.

"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.  I prefer toys that you can put away after the child is done using it.",0

"IN Book one I was totally thrown at the end... I was so frustrated because it ended as a cliffhanger ..and if I have never said it enough times ..Smiling)...I truly DISLIKE cliffhangers... Having said that Ms Devereaux was kind enough to send me book 2 for a free read and review as I did the first book ..Book 2 ......IS AWESOME,Exciting,Raptourous(sp?) ... OH I could go on and on ...  but seriously book 2 really gets into the ""nitty gritty"" of the storyline ..guess you could say the bones of who Sophie and Marc really are .... and what transpires between them and the other characters of their lives...Her writing is beautifully and wonderfully done... Sophie and Marc's characters are so developed in this book that you understand them far better ..The plot holds you from page one ..just as in book 1 you have the suspense , mystery and a glimpse into some BDSM ...even tho the sex scenes were more detailed in my opinion they were still not Explicit sexual content.....but they were good :)
I only have a slight sign of negativity and it starts around chptr 12 / 13 and goes on for a few chptrs ..you kinda get aggravated at the wishy washy ways between the 2 characters and makes ya want to reach in the book and slap Sophie into Submission  yourself..but.
 Ms Devereaux  comes back with a kicker..
Even tho Sophie and Marc's story is still unfinished ..... book 3 & 4 of this series jumps into a completely  new set  of characters.from what I have been led to believe in reading the reviews of them I myself have not read them ...
For me this book ranks 5 stars and book 1 would have been 5 stars but I was frustrated at the ending cliffhanger ... this one wasn't quite so bad ...but alas you still have a cliffhanger at the end...
I received this book as a free read for an honest  review",0

"The story was well written but left you wanting to know so much more about the characters intimate moments with each other. What there was left you wanting so much more. YOU experienced their downfalls, frustrations and longings but it stopped there. Doesn't speak well of a supposed lesbian love story.

"JoJo Moyes really knows how to make me cry. Or maybe it is just Louisa Clark that makes me cry. I don't mean sobbing heartbreaking cry the way Me Before You did but I mean like just happy soul rending grief tinged cry.  I really enjoyed that the author took the time out to heal Louisa in the slow painful way of humans. Grief is hard and especially hard when you aren't left a stipend and a way to remove yourself from the things that remind you most of the departed person. I just appreciated how - human- the author made Louisa. Its not like a whole book later she was magically healed. This was sticky and messy. In many ways i doubted her just as she doubted herself. It wasn't fair of me but thats life.

Clark was remarkably human and beautiful for it. Im curious as to her next adventure however i don't know if i outright want to continue with the series.if this is series.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100",0

"Why you should read it: I love the idea behind parallel worlds, and Amy Nichols gives readers something even more interesting  we get to see the couples from both parallel worlds! While You Were Gone is the sequel to Now That You're Here, and in this installment we get to see the other Danny and Eevee. The author did a fantastic job in differentiating between the two Dannys and the two Eevees. I recommend this for any fan of parallel-universe stories and YA.

INTERVIEW WITH AMY NICHOLS

How was writing this version of Danny and Eevee?

Amy: Writing this Danny and Eevee was both challenging and rewarding. The first book gave me hints at who these parallel characters were, but I didn't really come to know them until working on the second or so draft of While You Were Gone. Eevee was more difficult to get a lock on than Danny. Once I understood her relationship with art, though, her part of the story came together. Danny I understood from the start, but I didn't anticipate how his story would affect me emotionally. He really broke my heart. At one point while writing I had to walk away from the computer and go have a good cry.

What would the other ""you"" be like?

Amy: I recently returned from The Schrodinger Sessions, a workshop in quantum physics for science-fiction writers put on by the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland, so right now I'm totally geeked out on science. I just know one of my parallel selves didn't get bored with science in high school, but rather pursued a career in it and is actively exploring all the weird and unexplained things about her universe.

I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).

This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.

The Sony name is good, but this product is relatively brittle. I would recommend it only for someone who will use it for light-duty purposes.

I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years.

"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not.

"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.",0

This is a Novella and is best read after reading books 1-4 in the series. Everything comes to a happily ever after and leaves nothing hanging in this story, but don't fret, there are more to come in River Bend.

Molly McLain once again has captured my heart with this endearing group of characters and transported me back to their little town that I fell in love with in Cant Shake You.",0
"Red is available for the $24.99 price. I saw it for the first time last night and I am very happy I did.  The sound is crystal clear and it is nice to have it in my DVD player.  The movie is a very good movie.  The only thing I would change is to order it from Amazon.  I am glad I did.I love this movie.  I have watched it many times.  I like that the actors are better than the director.  I hope the director has a better script.This is a great movie.  It has a lot of action, great story, and it is not as big as a horror movie.  I would recommend this movie to any horror fan.  Great movie for a good price.  My 3 year old loves it.  I hope I can get another one in the future.My 2 year old loves this show!

"The work light work OK so far. It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away. It needs on power button and one mode button.",0

This is an interesting though flawed revisionist take on the on-going battle between angels and demons. Add in a further fictionalized Frankenstein monster (aka Adam) to the mix and the result is a rip-roaring actionfest with some strains of prophecy and fantasy.

"Wicked for You is another delicious Wicked Lovers novel by Shayla Black. Mystery Mullins, daughter of a famous Hollywood actor/director and Axel Dillon, her hero rescuer, are the focus of this book 10 in the Wicked Lovers series. The characters were well developed and grew along with the story. There were a couple surprises along the way that I wasn't expecting, which were great!

Axel is a large and extremely sexy man/Dom. His attitude toward what he is, is very serious. I was surprised to see that even he has insecurities. As serious as he is about being a Dom, his feelings for Mystery are so deep that he finds it a constant struggle to keep a scene going instead of just making love to her. What ever they're doing, it's done with plenty of steam rolling off the pages! Mystery strikes me as not having a great deal of common sense. Not exactly an airhead but close. Of course, that could be from being raised as a teenager with all the Hollywood glitz and glamour. As an adult, she's more grounded in the real world. Heath is the one I really feel bad for. Unrequited love is a horrible thing to have to deal with. Maybe we'll see him with his own story in the future.  The story had a natural flow along with some backstory to make you understand why things were happening the way they were. This was another great read from an author who NEVER disappoints! I can't wait for the next one.",0

"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author.  Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap.",0

They both sound great.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it has a small gap where it attaches to the wall. I haven't seen it in action yet. I would recommend it to anyone.I have been using a gb12x2 for about a year and have had no problems.  It is light, but very useful for transferring pictures to my laptop.  I have had it for about a year now and I am very pleased with it.

The only negative I have is the power switch.  I have to charge it every day, so I would prefer to have a power switch, but it is a pain in the butt to turn it on.  It does not seem to work well with my gb12x2.  I would recommend it for those who use their gb12x2 and want to use it with their laptop.I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.

Then in between I take her to the field with this long lead where she can run in a wide circle, play fetch and sniff around as long as it's within a 26 circumstance of me.  The leash allows me control if an unexpected person or animal comes into sight versus being off lead.  It helps me burn her energy more effectively then a regular short leash walk (since I'm not a runner). I've taught her directions such as left, right, stop, back, let's go, etc. so she still has to follow my lead. It's been very durable and has NOT jammed even when fully extended.  The retraction is great and allows for more freedom of movement without getting tangled around her compared to the old string leads.",0
"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

"I have bought this type of fuel for years not only for myself but for my wine and coffee cafe. I also have several different fireplace types I use it in. My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

This is not a big issue for me but I have a pair of Sony dSLR speakers that I use all the time. I'm very happy with my purchase. Overall, it's a good buy. The sound quality is not great, but it's ok. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great camera for the price. I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones. I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price. I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this. The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the cost is a bit higher than other cameras, and the pictures are much better. The camera is very easy to use and easy to use. The only drawback is that it has a little lag when you're shooting photos, which I have to take care of. However, I'm not sure if that is a problem because I'm using the camera on a tripod.",1

PROS:
- They are indeed light, and very sleek. Don't look bulky at all.
- They have great sound. They don't cancel noise very well, but I didn't want complete noise cancellation anyway (I think it's dangerous when you're walking on the street.)
- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.
- They don't look or feel expensive. Granted these aren't expensive at all, but ""lightweight"" shouldn't mean cheap-feeling plastic.

I would buy this product again. For the price, it does what I want. Nothing more, nothing less.",0

"Jack Black recently released School of Rock, a film where he releases the inner rockers from the well to do children in a posh, private school.  Tenacious D is Jack's rock child let loose upon America.
Set in the open mike clubs of L.A. Jack and Kyle suffer misadventure after misadventure looking for ""insparado"" (the secret behind great song writing) and their next gig.
Like Spinal Tap, these guys are talented but have no idea how insipid and dumb their material is.  They perform with great energy and that raises them far above the songs they are singing.  In one episode Jack and Kyle are trying to write a new song and the melody is farmiliar.  As they stop to congratulate themselves on a job well done an ice cream truck goes by their apartment and they realize they've just put words to the ice cream song.

"I have the standard Litter Genie, and I think it's the greatest! I don't understand the negative reviews--in one, it almost sounds like the person was trying to empty their whole litter box into the Genie. Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie.
Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.

I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.

I like my Genie so much that I'm going to buy another one, just because I'm lazy and don't want to tote the one I have to the second litter box! I am very, very pleased with my purchase.",0

"There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.",0

"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.",0

Anthologies have come a long way. The characters are well developed and the story is well told. The story is well-written and the characters are well-developed.

This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.

The book takes the reader from the early days of the Second World War to the present day and to the present day.

"Ruth Soukup's new book Living With an Unseen Eye is a refreshing glimpse into a world that has been submerged by the West's economic decline. The author explains the reasons why it is so difficult to stay in the West, how it came about, and how to move back home. It is a great read, and I recommend it highly. I was so happy to see the first book in this series! I love the characters and their story line! It's very refreshing to see the characters in action again. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great read. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one. This book is a must read for all of us. I couldn't put it down. I have to say I had a hard time putting it down. It was a story that I was deeply interested in. I love the characters and the story line. I thought this was a great book to read.

"This is a very dense bone that is 5.5 inches long by about 2 inches wide.  My 80 lb greyhound loves it.  It's almost too big for him.  I do think it cleans his teeth because he has to work so hard gnawing at it to get even the tiniest chunk to come off the end.  He only gets through about half of this bone before he's full and tired.  Then I remove it and save it for the next day.  The 4 stars are because it's messy.  It leaves orangish debris on his bed that is sticky and gross, in my opinion, not his :-)  He'd give it a 10.",0

It was somewhat interesting in that respect.",0
Ms Binchy expresses in the simplest of terms ... The humanness of the ordinary person. It's a fragile embrace that this writer bestows on each character. In a few short words she creates a bond between readers and her characters. She's a lovely writer who seamlessly brings ideals to the forefront.,0

This works very well for us. We have a well and I worry about contaminates. The water tastes different after filtering. It tastes much better and cleaner. I have had well water most of my life but after moving to a different home the water did not taste good at all but this takes care of that. The water flow does slow down after about 6 weeks or so for us. We replace the filter every six to eight weeks. We have been using these for about 4 years now and will continue using.,0

"I loved Beg for Mercy and Hide from Evil. This book is a part of a series. I was really excited this book came out. As soon as I saw it I grabbed it. This is Talia story. She is getting her life back together after she was tortured. She was in awful 'relationship' which is mentioned in Beg for Mercy. She was helped by Jack. I liked Talia the most part but she got stupid which I found annoying. Jack our hero is there to protect/help Talia (she doesn't know he was)had potential but he fell flat for me. This book talks about Gemini Security/Gemini Men. I felt like Alden was just trying to get me to buy those books. Not going to happen.  This book seemed rush and didn't have the depth I felt in Beg for Mercy and Hide from Evil. Not a terrible book but I certainly won't be grabbing a book by Alden just b/c she wrote it.  By the way, if you want to read this book I recommend you read Beg for Mercy 1st. It explains the back story which you really don't get in this book. If I didn't read the 1st 2 books in the series I think I would have given it 2 stars.",0
"Fifteen-year-old Callie has a rare gift for the story, which is a book that makes the reader feel like she's living the story.

"There is no more imoortant job than being a stay at home mom (or dad). And this book reads like talking to a wise and supportive friend. In Stay At Home Mom: Lousy Pay, Lousy Hours, Priceless Rewards, Ali Bierman tells sweet stories about raising her kids, as a stay at home mom, throws in some profound quotes and most important, packs the book with useful real world tips. She is a very creative person and uses that to channel love into her kids and teach us new ways to do the same. There are also surprises and gifts from the author! But my favorite part was finding out how her kids turned out when they grew up. Highly recommended to any parent (even if you cant find a way to stay at home). 5-stars.",0
"Ben Affleck may be the most interesting part of the film.  He's a guy who has to be so damn good at making a movie that is worth watching, so he should be nominated for an Academy Award.  Affleck is a movie about a man who has to make a movie that is worth watching.  I think it's a great movie, but I've seen it several times.  This movie is a must see for any movie buff.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is into Affleck, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Affleck.  I've seen Affleck in a number of movies, and I've found his acting to be very convincing.  I was a huge fan of his in ""Berserkers"" and ""The Fountainhead"", so I thought it would be a good addition to my collection.

The movie starts off well with the story of a woman who is a woman who has a lot of power and how she chooses to act.",1

"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months.",0

"I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came back
to get some ""parchment with a magical message""  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM.

"This book was so inspiring as well as riveting.  Jenna has a wonderful talent for being totally honest about her life while at the same time conveying the lessons she's learned with wisdom and maturity.  She also talks a lot about relationships and just how hard they can be and when you really love someone just how much you have to put up with, and sometimes (when it comes to relationships) just when you should walk away.

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

This is definitely the kind of book you could read over again and still gain new insight, not to mention all the beautiful photographs.",0

"Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.

For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box.

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen.",0

"DID NOT WORK FIRST TIME

I had to go through the instructions for it to work. I was pretty disappointed. If you want to get a solid solid product, you have to take it apart first. It was hard to get the screws to tighten. If you are replacing a drill press, you have to take it apart first. If you are replacing a screwdriver, you have to take it apart first. This screwdriver is a great tool. It works great.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value.I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to use. It was easy to install. I bought a couple of additional sets of the other one for the garage. They are all excellent.",1
"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

Overall, I've been a little frustrated about a couple of things, but generally pleased with this purchase.",0
"These forks were just what I've needed to supplement the seafood tools I already had.  I am a lobster lover and will not waste a single morsel of the little claws.  These help me get it all.

"I have tried the OXO (Cordless) and I have not found a difference. The cordless OXO is much better and is cheaper than the Cordless OXO. I have been using this OXO for about a year now and it has not moved. It is very easy to use and I can use it on my OXO. I just put the OXO in my microwave. I have a hard time cleaning it because it is so dirty. I would recommend this OXO for anyone who needs to clean a microwave or microwave oven. I have used it on a couple of my other OXO's and I like it so much I bought another one for my family. It is also a good quality. I am very happy with this purchase. Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It was a little stiff but that's how it was intended to be. She loved it!  I'll definitely buy it again. Nice, thick, easy to clean, and I like that it holds a lot of items. I have a ton of items in this bag, and I have a lot of items in the freezer. These bags are very convenient and easy to clean. I bought 2 sets of these bags, one for my son and one for my daughter.",1

These pans are not flimsy, definitely non-stick and stacking them is not an issue because they bend in whatever direction you need them to. I'm very happy.",0

"We adopted Beast, a 60 lb mutt in early October. He seemed to be great, until he started eating my boyfriends things when we were gone at work. My boyfriend decided to buy a camera so we can see what he's doing when we're gone. Lo and behold the poor guy is so anxious he is howling the whole time we are gone! We had no idea! It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wits end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar was on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera. He started to howl and the collar beeped 3 times, and when he didn't stop, it finally zapped him. Yes, it was heartbreaking to hear him yelp, BUT he stopped!! (and it would have been more heartbreaking to give him away). Finally!! He only wears it when we are gone and it's super important to put it on the right way, or else it won't work.
First you have to make sure it's right under his head, not low on the neck where a regular collar would sit, but literally right underneath his head.
Then you have to make sure it's tight to the point where the actual box won't move if the dog scratches/shakes. You should still be able to fit one finger in, but it should be TIGHT.
Then you have to give a good shake before you go, so it's touching the dog's skin, NOT HIS FUR!

Works seamlessly when both sources are the same resolution (eg both 1080p, or both 1080i) but produces a glitchy output if the input resolutions differ (one 1080i and one 1080p). Small and portable, and works pretty well. I wish I could figure out a way to use the USB port for controlling the switch. If anybody's figured this out, do let me know!",0

"I thought this was a great book! I really liked Angry Housewives, first one I read by her. I wasn't sure about this one 'quirky characters'...hadnt i read enough of quirky characters? but the characters really surprised and i loved that each beginning chapter was written in first person by violet and then switched to 3rd. She said things in the first part that related to upcoming parts so you 'knew' something was going to happen but you were never sure. Great book, fun characters that sing in a band you feel like you are one of the Clamshells as well (you have to read the book!) It is fantastic to see how Violet turns out greater and greater as life goes on for her. You definitely root for her :)",0

"In the beginning for the first ... Maybe 40 pages (well until Eric and Rebecca meet) it was quite boring. I was tempted to put it down but I know Staci Stallings is a good writer so that caused me to stick it out and it was a very good read. It's interesting to see how our view of ourselves are projected onto how we think others see us. We look at the outward appearance, what a person has or looks like and we do long to be like them but in reality, they are hurting as well just a little better at hiding it. I think everyone could see a little bit of themselves in the characters. They are real, honest to goodness, messed up, characters.",0

It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ??????????

"This is the greatest comic ever written and for good reason.  It takes place in the ""real"" world, during the mid eighties.  This story looks at the charector behind the mask, what makes that person tick, and how they got in the costume.  The story starts off simple, a murder, and evolves into something that effects the fate of the world.  A good portion of the story takes place in flashbacks, and shows how much effort and thought went into this story and how everything is connected together.  Another thing about this story is that it doesnt give away anything early, like in most comics, we find out when the charectors do. And in the end when you are done you will realize why this the greated comics ever writtten.",0

I hope Michael Craven writes more books and movies about these characters.  This is a must read,1
"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,",0

For large fingers the center of the remote could be a little cumbersome.  The buttons seem a little close to me and I have medium sized hands.  That is the only tiny issue.

The remote emits a stronger signal than all the original remotes is seems!  I can point it anywhere and it will do the job.

DVR controls work perfectly.  The button layout is different ( DVR remote) but took me a few minutes to figure them out and get use to it.

"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies.",0

A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch.

"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park.""

"Winner of a bevy of national publications, the book is a refreshing glimpse into a period of the past.  The story is told from a very different point of view.  In his first published novel, John Gorman, a young British soldier from the early days of the war, is forced to flee to France to escape the Nazi occupation.  When he is rescued, he is told he is a spy for the Gestapo and is on his way to a Nazi concentration camp.  The story is told from a very different point of view, which is why I recommend it.  The book is a delightful read, and I especially enjoy the characters.  The book is filled with references to other books and to a few other writers.  I can't recommend it enough.  I was very impressed by the writing style of the author.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.  I was expecting a bit of romance but that didn't happen.  I wanted to love the book and would recommend it to others.Great book.  A great story that was very well told.

"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish.",0

"This is a very preliminary review. I'm a little miffed that I'm even writing it. Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues. Love the nightlight, btw.",0

"The book starts off with the main character at a young age with a foreshadowing event. Then we skip forward in time to a teenage Emmy sneaking in the house. There are some funny moments in the story, it does take awhile to build the story and some parts seen slow.

There was an undercurrent of a love story but enjoyed the twist. I will honestly say my review and eating is also based off the fact that there is supposed to be a second book.

"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend.",0

"I've been wanting a Starrett for a long time now. I'm a professional electrical guy and have always had an interest in the design of solid and flexible electrical devices. After a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.

The price was right and I'm very happy with it. I have used it on a number of projects and I'm very happy with the quality and performance of the product. The product is very well made and it is well made. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to hang your electrical devices on the wall. I think you'll be very happy with the quality of the product.

"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to work out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.  As a matter of fact, I now enjoy using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-800GRXL-Indoor-Barbeque-and-Grill/dp/B000A76VCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville 800GRXL Indoor Barbeque and Grill</a>&nbsp;instead.

The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.

"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.
I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.
The end of this book was fairly decent.  I can't say this book was better than the last two, however.",0

"I am addicted to the Bill Gastner Mysteries.  I've read every one and have gone on to read the continuing saga in the series entitled Posadas County.  The author has developed a group of citizens living and working in Posadas who have varied, realistic, interesting and entertaining  personalities. Very quickly the reader is drawn into the events taking place and into the lives of those involved.  There are usually, if not always, two ""mysteries""  to solve in each book.  The author weaves them together throughout the story without giving away the hows and whys until the end.

This series is well worth your time to read and enjoy.  Soon the little town of Posadas and it's citizens will become real to you as they did to me.",0

"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",0

"Not everyone falls in love with an island.  But I did.  The best part of the film is the crew's ability to both enjoy and wonder if the island is really there.  They both look at the land in a way that makes it seem like it's there.  They both realize that they are the most beautiful people on the island and that the island has all of the qualities that make it beautiful.  But the film is shot with a camera that is better than anything else in terms of sound, color, and camera angles.  The colors are just gorgeous.  And it's a beautiful film that doesn't fall into the ""dark"" category.  The reason I like this film is because it has such an amazing cast.  It's also a film that was made to show people the beauty of the island.  I never saw this film before and I was really not expecting that.  It's a great film.  But I really enjoyed it because of the boat scene that took place on the island.  The boat scene is the best part of the film.  It's a great scene",1

It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest. My dog also likes some of the soft treats she gets but she doesn't like the soft ones.",1

I have been using it for a couple weeks now and it has stopped my little one from getting sick from all the other brand's fleas.  I can't say enough about this product.  My cat was able to eat it with no problems at all.  My vet said it was a good product, but not the best.  She also said it was not necessary for cats that are resistant to fleas.

The bracket design for the hot air tool is not very good as it has the tendency to eject the tool if not fully pushed in.  The hot air tool slid down slightly and partially melted the bracket after a few days of use.  The iron is capable of using Hakko tips but the element cover is tight on some of the tips due to the venting holes being punched in.  Using a drill to de-burr the element cover resolved the issue.

"Hey! you know that Chance scouted out the location of the canyon when he was haveing her plane connections delayed and rerouted.
I loved the way L. Howard kept the character of Chance true to form from one story to the next.
Also if John is old enough to have a girlfriend he is old enough to get caught up in some machinations that needs Zane and Chance to rescue him and set him on the path of his two uncles'- besides Zane needs to produce another daughter and Chance one to put them into a hilarious competition [aided and abetted by their wives]
there are still enough up close stories to be told with Mary and Wolf still in the background -- and lets go back in time to Michael's and Josh's stories.
I, along with so many others, agree that this has been the best family series ever written - with all of the ladies well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classics -
With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she does a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.  Love only comes from giving.
I do love a woman who is willing to take care of her own self-preservation [grin] and dragging a man into realizing her worth.

So I gave three but I wanted to give two stars. This is very expensive first off to not be a great product. Now the sizing I would def size up if you don't like it to be so tight. As the day goes on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 weeks after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy sucks cause you have to keep the tags on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 days regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well! Eventually you will get the body back!,0

"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"I gave this as a gift, but we all enjoy it.  The frame has handy features and is easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).  Before I would have to sit at the computer and look at them, which is nice too, but I seldom did it.  You can tell I love this frame, the good thing is that the recipient loves it too and has been so happy to have it.",0

"Airlea was briefly introduced in the first book and when she comes to work with Dante's rehabilitation you really get to know her. She is one fiesty physical therepist that Dante just seems drawn to, and their chemestry is explosive.

Another great read Airlea's attitide about life make her a great character to get to know. And I loved seeing Dante's growth throughout the book.",0

"As an outside sales rep, I do a lot of walking. By the end of the day, my feet are killing me. I'd never heard of these before. I guess I was buried under a rock or something. The shoes feel great. It's only been two weeks so I'll come back in months from now to do a complete review. They are snug and fit well. I could probably have gone a half size longer but am ok with the 11. They give a tremendous amount of support while feeling like walking in the most comfortable pair of sneakers. They look great with my Khakis which I where almost daily while working. They are very casual looking. I am pleasantly surprised.",0
"This waterproof bag is easy to carry and the materials are thick enough to make it comfortable to carry. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic bags in the case as they were not well protected. If you're thinking about going with this bag, you should definitely consider a 2 pack with a 2-5 pack or a 3 pack with a 3 pack. Overall, I would not buy this bag again. It works great.",1
"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that.",0
Good but far from Gladwell's best.  The argument that small is better was a bit of a stretch.  I do appreciate the style and detail that Gladwell offers.,0

"This book is different from any story I ever read. While it starts as a regular suspense, it soon turns into a grabbing thriller where the emotion and suspense escalate with every page. I had trouble putting it down as I followed the tribulations of the heroine Dorrie. Morgan Mandel does a great job at keeping us turning the pages as we discover Dorrie's problems and wonder how she will react. The villains are great too, each with a convincing motivation to explain their actions. This is the first book in a series and we can't wait for the others.",0

Nicole Kidman was a treat, seeing her in a completely different role. Jennifer Aniston was very funny, as was Dave Matthews. We absolutely loved Bailey Madison, the daughter. She's a great little actress and should go very far in the industry. Dont expect the best comedy of the year, just expect a great rental, no smut, no bad language and just a funny cast of characters.",0
"Back in 2011 I got a chance to read Because of You by Jessica Scott. This is where you first meet Shane Garrison and Jen St. James. I strongly suggest you read that story first, before jumping into this novella. However, it is just a suggestion. Here's why:

In Anything for You Shane and Jen have been together for sometime. Shane is about to do something and he's afraid to tell Jen what he is about to do. I don't know what the man was thinking when he thought it was a good idea not to tell Jen. Fortunately, he has a good buddy who has talked some sense into him. I know this is very vague, but it's a novella. If I say to much, I might tell the whole story. Plus, a lot of the background is in the first book of the  Coming Home series. Overall, it is a quick read (seriously) in which you get to see Shane and Jen work out there relationship and over come there fears of what could happen. It was enjoyable and it's nice to see Jen and Shane again. So, I actually hope you get to read both stories Because of You and Anything for You. So, I leave you today and I hope it's wonderful.",0

The color is vibrant and the shoe is comfortable.  I wish I had gotten the two pairs for the same price.  I love the color and the fit.  They are a little heavier than I expected, but I guess I'll keep them for when I go back to New England for a day of walking around the house.  I have a wide foot and these fit well.  I'm a size 12 and ordered a medium.  The medium fit me perfectly.  It's a little snug around the toes and the heel does not dig into my toes.  It's also a little loose in the toe",1

"No historian covers financial subjects as well as Ron Chernow. This book on Hamilton, as well as his previous efforts on John Rockefeller (Titan) and JP Morgan (The House of Morgan) are thoroughly researched, clearly written and offer entertaining reading, despite covering complicated topics.

  One reviewer suggested that Chernow was more comfortable in the 19th century than the 18th and I suppose that is true.

  But this book, in my view, is superior to Titan. In Titan, I felt Chernow was to some extent a slave to chronology. He seemed determined to devote about a chapter to every period of Rockefeller's life. When Rockefeller retired in his 40s, Titan lost a lot of its focus. Rockefeller lived to be 90, and I felt a lot of the second half of that book was padding.

  With Hamilton as a subject, there was no way for the author to fall into that trap again. Hamilton's origin and youth in St. Croix are still shrouded in mystery, and, not to spoil the ending, but I assume most readers are aware of Hamilton's rather sudden demise at the age of 49.

  That of course was too bad for Hamilton, but it makes for a more exciting book. We see Hamilton as a grown man and soldier in the American Revolution by chapter three and then leading an eventful live that makes for a lively biography, when the author is up to the task.

  As Chernow most certainly is.

  This book took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what is next for Mr. Chernow, but I actually was expecting, after Rockefeller and Morgan that he would do a biography of Carneige.

  Then his publishers could package the set as ""The Tycoon Triology""",0

"I think I own about 10 pair of Cushe shoes, probably more. They are about the only brand of casual shoes I wear. I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks. If you have not tried them and want a super comfortable shoe, obviously since I have 10 pair I'm sold on them.
Only reason for 4 stars. The shoes I received do NOT have the type of laces shown, which was a major factor in deciding to buy this shoe. I have another pair in a different color that does have the shown lace, and I like them much better. I'm a bit disappointed because the laces shown look better and you don't have to mess with tying them. I will probably write the seller and ask if they can send me the laces shown. But, it's not really worth the hassle of retuning the shoes. If Cushe wasn't such a great product I would have slammed this, but I just can't!",0

They have a secure snap closure, they type found on fine jewelry, not that silly hook finding that breaks off so easily.

"These are exactly what I was looking for!
They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

I like it and the color is nice. It is bright and bright. I have it mounted on a 3/4 inch tree and it is pretty sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is the mounting hardware is a little difficult to use. I used this as a small light and it is good. I was very disappointed with the price of this light. I received it on a discount. I plan to buy another one as a backup. This is a very nice tool. I was looking for a tool that could fit my old saw and it's a great tool.

The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

Our dog knows that if he has to go, that's the place to do it. He knew, instinctively what it was for, probably because it's very similar to grass. Have had it for a couple of months and washed it several times. It's held together very well, and am so happy I spent the money. Game changer for having a dog. No more house accidents. Well once, but he was just trying to get attention.",0

"I have the biggest smile on my face after reading this book; it's the stuff your dream romance is made of.  It's honest, mature, sexy, relevant, engaging and most importantly its romantic; swoon worthy.

I started this book ready to resist liking Arden.  While she is still not my favorite character in this series, the author did a phenomenal job making her softer and vulnerable while staying true to her ""real' personality.  I certainly understood her better by the end of the book and look forward to the author unveiling the rest of her complicated layers. I think the good doctor is just what she needed in more ways than one.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.  The men of this series are the type of men that every girl dreams of one day making their very own.  Well done.  I do have a question......Who is up next?",0
Not even Nathan Lane can lift this otherwise mediocre film out of ordinariness. The chemistry between Sorvino and Kilmer is just not believable no matter how many sculptures she finishes.

"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.",0

"We have been offshore sailors for many years.  We could not even finish watching this movie that was obviously written by, directed by, and acted by non-sailors.  Our frustration came from watching a completely ill prepared bumbling fool try to deal with critical emergencies in slow motion.  After the initial problem the rest of the troubles were created by the character through mistakes and inaction.  Because he even played this role I have lost a little more respect for Robert Redford.",0

Mortimer is fresh on the job but Heidi doesn't make it easy for him. She is not scared and in fact they become fast friends that blooms into much more. Rules are broken and consenquences are to be had. This is a side of the Boogeyman that you won't see coming. This is a paranormal but with a twist. It is not all the bad that comes with being the Boogeyman, but the sweet that people see in each other.",0

"Olivia Harcourt will do anything to protect her late stepsister's little girl, Jamie, but with danger licking at their heels, she's going to need help from a group of shifters called the Watchmen. Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way. Tiger-shifter Aiden Shrader is one of the Watchmen assigned to them, and an instant attraction develops between Olivia and him. Forced to drive a long distance trip to safety, they can't help being around each other, nor stop the desire flaming.

Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her? Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction",0

"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically.",0

"The vast majority of international terrorism conducted on a spectacular scale is State-sponsored. A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways. As withe the Red Brigades the Baader-Meinhof faction showed their gullibility because both groups were created by and controlled by NATO intelligence. Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots.",0

"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers.",0

"The Three Laws are:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

"I owned several knives including Gerber, Buck, Smith and Wesson, and I've got to say, this Kershaw knife is a great surprise. The feel of this knife is so sturdy, I love the weight distribution and the solid, yet silky smooth action of the blade on its hinge. I can flip this knife open easily with a flick of my wrist due to its weight.

The steel is very interesting. I love the two types of steel fused together with copper...one stronger and harder to provide the a good base to attach the softer, more easily sharpened edge piece...I don't know how operationally effective it will turn out to be in the long run but the concept is great and so far I've had no problems.

WARNING: IF LEFT WITH MOISTURE THIS BLADE WILL RUST. DUE TO THE MATERIALS USED THE BLADE WILL DEVELOP RUST IF LEFT UN-OILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN DAMP AREAS. IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY BE SURE TO STORE THE KNIFE WITH A LIGHT SHEEN OF OIL ON IT.

The above is mentioned in the knife manual that comes in the package but it is not mentioned in the product details, which it probably should be. Luckily I read the directions when they're provided so I will be able to prevent rust on this beautiful knife.

Highly recommended although I would imagine there are probably better knives to purchase if you are going to be abusing this knife. I just find it much too attractive of a knife to risk scratching, chipping, or scuffing it.",0

"Awesome kit, simple yet fun at the same time. Absolutely love the Twin Drive system, and how it's just as posable and articulate as the figure itself. One minor nitpick is that the GN swords don't hold up nicely when placed in the hands, they are loose and will fall out when trying to pose this figure. Other than that, it's a really awesome figure, easy to put together, and overall the product is great. If you love and are a hardcore fan of Gundam, get this and add it to your collection. Highly recommend it.",0

"Kill Bill Volume 1 is mesmerizing from the very first few seconds.  Simply one of the best films I have ever seen.  Startling real, not formulated, a real joy, and a very tongue in cheek tribute to all those wonderful Hong Kong, Japanese and American martial arts films of my youth.  Of all the very excellent believable performances I have to single out Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishi a part that Ms. Liu has captured to the fullest.  Part viscous, aloof, funny, autocratic, determined, cruel and viperous I only wish we could see more of this ""empress of the Yakuza"" as a future film series as she has really captured the essence of this woman, this assassin, this powerhouse.  In addition Uma Thurman is the glue that holds this film together, and what a job she does of it.  I can hardly wait for Volume 2 to come out in February.  In the meantime rush to the theatre and consume Volume 1.",0
"First off, I bought the whole package, UltraHD Lighted Work Center, the UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool and the optional 3"" wheels for the bench.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics. I also own 6 of their Industrial Wire Shelving Units and they are excellent too. It is what you would expect from a quality piece.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these.",0

"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

Go for it.",0
"As with most Maxpedition Gear, the quality on the Travel Tray is very good. The size is just right for the things one usually leaves laying about and then can't find right away during travel.

"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.",0

"I am no longer a part of the YA age group. In fact I ignored my husband and children to read this series. I love them, and can't wait to read them with my kids when they are older.  The series is one of the best written in terms of showing the emotion and thoughts that happen with first love.  One of the great things that I appreciate about Eclipse is the way they discuss and work to maintain moral boundries while showing the turmoil that happens with temptation.  I love the story lines.  I woudn't be surprised to find Bella and Edward in my address book, that is how real these characters have become. I can't wait for Stephenie's upcoming books to be released! I even bought this series, which is a rarety for me!  I can't believe I can rave about a book about vampires.  The book is actually about differences, and we all have those in our relationships.

"I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont ""tell"" me how she feels, ""show"" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really ""don't give a frog.""  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).
I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought ""You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!"" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.
I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.
In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine.",0

"My first impression of this product was the quality and design of the product. The yellow coated one is a very bright green and the red coated one is a very bright yellow. I used this product to take my wife out to a local lake and enjoy the water. I ordered the yellow one and it is exactly as described and it has a very bright orange colored coating on the top. I did not want to spend $10 for a red one but I like that I can see the colored part of the product better. The color is very flattering to me and it fits perfectly into my red and green cycling shorts. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and it does not have any compression on the belt. The holster does not come with a clip on the back that is attached to the holster. It is a good holster for a single handed weapon and it is good for concealed carry.

It does come with a small clip on the back that is attached to the holster. It does not come with a belt clip on the back. It is a good holster for a single handed weapon and it does not come with a clip on the back",1

My daughter is still very young and still gets frustrated with it. I think it's a great toy and I think it's great for kids. I would not buy it again. It's just a good toy for young kids. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this. He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood. It does not come with any batteries and I can tell that it has had a few bad breaks and some slight splinters. But I'm happy with the purchase.",1

"Mia has had a crush on her brother Blake's best friend Drew for years. About a year ago, Drew betrayed Blake and there were devastating consequences. When Drew finally returns to school, he's scared and not the same boy he was before. He has no friends and no confidence. Mia still sees the same boy she has crushed on for years and when they are assigned to the same class project and have to spend time together, they rekindle a friendship. They shouldn't be together but they can't fight the feelings they have for each other.

I enjoyed this book but it was a lot more depressing and sad than I was expecting. My feelings were kind of torn on Drew at first but my heart just broke for him. I can't imagine having to live with the kind of guilt that he carried. Mia was a good heroine, she had a good heart and was very sweet. There were a few small things that bothered me about this story but overall I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more by this author.",0

Thank you SO much for such a quality product that simply makes my life better. Please click YES if my review has been helpful to you.",0

I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read historical fiction.This is a very good book. The author is always a good author. I think most of the reviewers have said it is a very good book. I just didn't get it. I think the writer did a great job of writing a story that was very interesting to read. The characters are very well developed and the plot interesting. I was very interested in this book. I would recommend it",1

"The compelling supernatural thriller THE HALLOWEEN is a refreshingly simple story about a couple who find themselves in the middle of a strange and bizarre world.  After a successful business venture, the couple discover that a mysterious woman has sent them to the depths of the woods.  In the meantime, the woman has the ability to make people believe the supernatural.  With her ability, the couple discover that the supernatural is a force for good, and that a person who is not afraid of his or her own existence is the one who can save them.  The story is a simple and well-acted tale of two young women who fall in love with each other. ",1
This is the best set of dice you can find. I will admit that my kids were pretty disappointed.,1
"Received this flashlight just before hurricane Matthew hit Florida.  Love it!!  Came with batteries installed so we could use right away. The adjustable head was so helpful, both to illuminate darker areas in kitchen for food prep, and also to use in the up position and it illuminated our entire great room ( 16 x 25 ft!)  Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.  Hope they get more sales as it's so useful in a power outage, and heaven forbid you are in a dangerous situation it has a very strong clip to clip to your belt/jacket/whatever.",0

"Update 12/28/15 - We've had this set for a few months now and it's just the right size. It's not the best quality, but it is the right size. The only thing that I do think is going to be a problem for a few years is to purchase the cheaper ones. We have 2 kids and love the plushie.  The items on this set are really cute.We got this for our Granddaughters 2nd birthday and they love it.  It's very light weight and is very easy to use.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" feel to it and that it is really easy to put together.  I also like that it is fairly easy",1
"So, this Augmented Reality thing sounded kind of gimmicky to me, but I was still curious and hey, the photo on the puzzle is pretty. It took me about a week to finish the puzzle in between a million other things I had to do. Most of it wasn't too terribly difficult - the hardest part was definitely the trees along the bottom. Took me as much time to do that almost as the rest of the puzzle.

At any rate, I downloaded the app and followed the instructions and it is kind of neat how the picture turns into a snowy landscape. My husband said, ""Oh, that's cool!"" But it wasn't an out-of-this-world experience for me. :-) I'm not sure that it was worth all the effort of putting the puzzle together if your only reason was to use the AR app. I don't think I'd go buy more of the AR puzzles unless I just really, really liked the picture.",0
"I've read all in the series thus far and really have enjoyed all of them. The characters are great and I like how different books dig deeper into different characters. I will say that there are still a lot of unanswered questions and that each book has a thread to the others but just enough is left to keep you wanting more. I guess this could be frustrating to some but to me it just keeps me anxiously waiting for the next one. The author hooks you and you just need to see what is going to happen, hope I don't have to wait long.",0

Works well after several sensitivity adjustments to eliminate false alarms in my particular environment. The sound is realistic enough when heard behind a closed door. In my estimation it will take a very perceptive burglar to determine that it is not a real dog behind the door. In terms of construction quality relative to the price I would rate it on the cheap side and that is why I am taking off one star. I have it connected to power via a WeMo switch and it turns on when i leave home and off when I return. This works only if no batteries are installed.,0
"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

"This is a great coloring case.  It has a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two sets of markers - pip squeak sized small markers and regular size.  As other reviews have noted, it costs about the same as it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and markers separately at full price.  The separates will go on sale, and so will this case.

Crayola is good quality.  The products are not light fast, so over time, pics left in windows or bright light will fade.  Colors are bright and markers last longer than dollar store products.  Crayons are the best, since many other brands are waxy and weak.  This set has washable markers, but not the washable crayons or pencils.  So, needs supervision for small children who might write on the wall.  Crayons are made in the US; pencils made in Brazil; case and markers made in Vietnam.

The carrying case has plastic shells glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers.  It looks all neat and tidy, and the latches hold it closed fine for carrying around.  I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tips have been damaged.  Sets drive me nuts when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets.  The plastic shell on this one won't come out, which is good for a full set, because I much sturdier, but means I can't gut it easily later.  The carrying case has a minion with teddy bear on one side and a minion playing a guitar on the other.

My particular set came with two of the same color crayon:  banana bonanza.  I know this means that I'm missing a color in my set, but I'm not OCD enough to go through and look at every crayon to find out which color got left out to allow room for that double.",0

"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!",0

All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film.

"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless.

I will say that the speaker is great, and it has a nice, natural sound.  The only complaint I have is that the speaker has a short cord, and the sound is not as good as",1

"The thumb release is the same movement as the thumb break holsters we're all used to.  Although I really like my Serpa, the thumb release is a much more natural and quicker movement.

When I first got my Safariland ALS and tried to reholster the weapon, I thought the holster was defective because it wouldn't go back in easily.  However, I learned in order to activate the retention system, I needed to reholster straight in, with the sights almost pressing against the top of the holster.

The lining really babies the pistol.  It's great.  Plus, the paddle is rock solid secure.

My only real gripe is that I wish the trigger guard was flatter.  It sticks out a bit, which rubs my middle finger when grasping to draw the weapon.

So far, the ALS is my favorite OWB holster.",0

"Spent a lot of time researching a not too expensive case for a Mosin M44 and an SKS.  Decided on this one and it has a ton of room; in fact added a VZ58 in the main compartment.  It is heavy but works, if I were lugging it around on my back I limit it to two rifles max,  but there is plenty of room.  No problems with quality, appears well made.  The hook & loop (velcro) straps in each rifle compartment are good and secure up to two rifles but recommend a gun sock on one or both as you cannot keep them from bumping without an additional two hook and loop straps which would require you to modify.
Shipping was quick and as quoted, however the box it came in was huge; you could literally pack an adult in it, so you know your case will arrive undamaged. :)

"My sons room is done in an alligator theme, and even though this is a dinosaur, it fits right in! I was so excited when I saw this, it's just so charming and fun for kids.

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great.",0

"This is one Christian film that has the potential to make you cringe.

The film has a couple of redeeming qualities. First, it is a very moving film. Second, it is a well-done movie. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Christian faith.

It was an interesting ending, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good Christian film.This is a great movie.

"McQuarrie is clearly a movie junkie.  This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.  But even if that's the case, it's still not worth it because it wasn't THAT funny.",0
"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing.",0

A good review is needed in order to give us a better understanding of the story.  I will say this.  The story is based on a true story of a man who went into the hospital and died after being attacked by a group of people.  His mother, who lived in the hospital and was very ill, went to see him.  He was attacked by a group of people and was later taken to a hospital.  He was then treated and eventually released.  He was a well-known personality and he was released.  He was a very popular character.  The story is very well told and the actors are very good.  He was a very",1

"I reviewed this movie after seeing it in theaters and gave it 3 1/2 stars. It has grown on me after seeing it a second time. I think it is on par with the first film, but the FF movie series suffers from too much comedy! I like comic book films to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our heroes seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing gets hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's states ""That Smarts""! and peels Reed off the wall like a cartoon!

Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior looks much better this time around and so are the effects. The Silver Surfer is a welcomed addition to the franchise and his FX are done extremely well! I know a lot of people were disappointed in Galactus being presented as a cloud but, I think an armor clad giant with a purple helmet would look ridiculous floating though space eating planets. The film is a bit short, but over all it's fun and captures the essence of the comic book.

This film is not perfect, but it is entertaining for fans of the series. I hope there will be a third entry in the series. I would like to address some problem with the Thing. I can see cross over's galore in the future and the Thing as he has been presented in these films wouldn't last one second with the Hulk if they ever do battle in a live action film! Anyway there will be lots more Marvel in the future.....I can't wait! The DVD transfer looks fantastic and there are plenty of extras to keep you busy.",0

"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James.",0

Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in?

"I won't add anything about the movie itself, but will comment on the commentary by Anthony R Santoro.  I have been reading about Prussia and Germany for many years and just finished ""The Iron Kingdom"" by Christopher Clark.  It is an excellent book about the history of Prussia from 1600 to 1947.  After finishing the book and then listening to the commentary by Santoro, I am shocked by the total inaccuracy of his commentary.  It was like returning to the1940 USA propoganda about Germany.
Great movie but almost everything about the commentary (which must be turned on) is a fiction.
Germany before and during WWII was not a cartoon character, and serious study must be undertaken to understand Prussia and Germany.  If USA citizens knew the history of the German States their attitude towards Germany would change dramatically.

The USA is blessed to not be bordered by more powerful countries; Germany historically was dominated by Russia, France, GB and Austria.  These countries ran roughshod over Germany for hundreds of years and Prussia and the rest of the German States lived in fear of the more powerful countries.",0

"I appreciate this book on so many levels, I don't know where to even start this review. The Life List by Lori Nelson Spielman is a study of a person's transformation from a life being led to a life worth leading. The journey, however, is not without its own set of trials and tribulations.

When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago.  It is only when Brett's mother passes away from cancer that the layers begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface.

To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it comes to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who has orchestrated some of the events Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goals she made when she was just 14 and as is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the items on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goals penned as a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.

Working through the list at first is challenging but watching her grow and evolve as she tackles each item, is miraculous, amidst surprise upon surprise but I will leave those surprises to be discovered by the reader.

I really enjoyed this and am sure others will too.

I looked in her mouth and her teeth didn't look bad but one was definitely broken in the back.  She took her to the vet the next day and now they have a huge dental bill to pull the teeth.  So aside from the fractured teeth, pain and huge vet bill........I guess they are just fine.",0

"The plot is good, the acting is good and the scenery is good.  The only fault I can find with this movie is the language.  The cursing is mild with only a few uses of three different expletives.  I have decided to rate (the many) movies I watch myself from the perspective of a Christian man looking for entertainment that won't teach my child to use curse words before her 3rd birthday.  I deduct 1 star for 1 or 2 expletives and automatically deduct another star for 3.  If I hear 4 or more or if any words are really offensive I stop it and it is rated 1 star regardless of any other considerations.  There is no nudity or blasphemous content.  This is one of those movies which makes no reference to God at all so it can't really be called Christian.  The rating systems in place are not adequate so I write my own reviews; I hope to help others like myself who would like to be forewarned if a movie is not acceptable viewing for the entire family.  This movie is not rated.",0

"Zoe Michaels lives with her boyfriend, Chase Hilliard, and their two best friends, Brody McNamara and Tate Winslow. Zoe and Chase have an extraordinary sex life and often shared their most sensual sexual fantasies at night. After Zoe creates one of Chase's fantasies for his birthday, he decides to reciprocate with a fantasy involving additional men. He involves Brody and Chase in the adventure.

The title of the anthology (this story is included in Four Play) is appropriate for this story as it involves the relationship between the Zoe, Chase and their two roommates. It goes well beyond a menage scenario as they continue to explore other fantasies. Chase and Zoe are completely uninhibited but the relationships begin to strain after a while.

It's well written and the complexity of the characters make it interesting beyond the sexual exploits. This is as sexually explicit a story as I've ever read so take that as a warning if that makes you uncomfortable. The emotional strains placed on each of them will surprise you and draw you into the story. It is well done.

Note that characters from Seducing Simon appear in this story.",0

"I have recently bought this book along with a couple of Osprey on British and French infantry tactics during Napoleonic wars.

Put it very briefly, get this book instead of the Ospreys. It covers not only infantry, cavalry, artillery but also naval warfare. The book gives numerous lively examples and accounts about the different achievements of each arm. One can find numerous battles explained with maps, each detailing the successes of a particular use of cavalry, artillery or infantry.

This little book does extremely well in its own modest and pedagogical way what others more convoluted writings fail to achieve: inspire!

As a conclusion: a well written and engaging entry level book. Happy with it and will read it again with pleasure.",0

Quinn has a way of writing that is just so witty.

Because of Miss Bridgerton might actually my favorite of all of Quinn's books. I read it in one sitting. I didn't want it to end and now I have to wait for the next Quinn book - that's the only negative side to her books! :)",0

I loved the way the story went about getting the books back on the market. I liked the fact that it was not just a series and it was written in a different style, but it was also a great read.

"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people.",0

Last, the price- it is pre ally no contest when compared to other fitness trackers.  In addition, this fitness tracker is a watch as well.

"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in",0
The story of how 300 years old people are reanimated after being exposed to the sun and the other elements.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.  The film was filmed in the 1980s and is a 2 hour documentary on the history of the universe.  The DVD features interviews with the film making crew and the crew members.  The movie is a continuation of the original film by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is about the creation of the universe.  This is the first time I have seen this film.

"5 Stars

This is the 13th book in this series by Hannah Ford and I have fallen in love with it. The suspense in this book is just like all the others. Each time this author puts words on the screen it is simply amazing.

This book has it all suspense, outrageous sex, domination and romance. You can't go wrong in this series and the cliffy with this book had me wanting to jump through the screen...This is not a series you can predict in the very first few books this author keeps you hanging each and every time.

Get this series is all I have to say

It's sturdy and has the little handle which makes it easy to grip and hold. I prefer this to the other travel bowl we purchased. So far it remains intact and hopefully stays that way! If you have a big dog and need something bigger this is definitely not for you. I'd recommend this for smaller dogs.

"Lighting can set the mood, whether you want a relaxing atmosphere or and exciting one, lighting can be used to create it. I received the Ohuhu Ocean Wave LED Light Projector and Speaker to review and it is wild!
This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.
This lamp is great in the living room, bedroom or even a kid's room. You can experience the tranquil waves of color from the Ocean Waves Projector by scooting over to Amazon. Flood your room with color!",0

I still remember reading his work, especially his ""The Key to the Universe.""  I think it's a good read, especially if you are a child.  I've heard of David H. Lawrence, but I think I am more likely to be interested in his other works.  I highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book.

I've always wanted an Authentic NFL game ball just to have. I got this ball for $60 + tax which is a great deal. Very pleased with the quality and price. I've always noticed that game balls are real dark and when I got this one it was much lighter in color and real slick. On the box it has instructions  to revitalize the tacky grip. Take a Wilson  specific football brush (which I don't have just a stiff bristle brush will do) and brush the wax off the ball with moderate pressure. Take a damp cloth and wipe ball down and brush again. After it dried I brushed again to bring the shine and tack back. I used a paper towel and some dye came off but this is normal. This darkens the ball and brings the tack back to it. I've repeated this process twice and the ball looks and feels great. I included a couple of pics of each side of the ball.,0
This movie is as well written as the movie. I saw it for the first time and am so glad I did. The script and acting is top notch. I would recommend it to anyone who loves action movies.

Instead, there was almost constant commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman during the time the movie was playing.  His dialogue blocked out a lot of the movie dialogue.

This was a pleasure to read. The amount of research the author did for this book is astounding. She didn't just take liberties on writing something in 1812 and do with it as she pleaded. She wrote a book that takes place in 1812 and follows the rules of that era. Throughout the entire book everything was astonishingly accurate and detailed. The main character was great in that she was consistent and stayed true to the time. Which I find greatly appreciated. And all of the side characters were wonderfully done as well. I found myself pulled to a few of them and look forward to reading the next book when it comes out. It's a thick and detailed book but definitely worth a read. I feel like I got lost in a Jane Austen novel that just happened to be written in our time. Quite fantastic.,0

"I had a chance to listen to these at a local audio shop. I wasn't too impressed at all. Really disappointing sound quality considering the price. The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too.",0
"Let me start off by telling you that this story is not your typical romance story. Is it even possible to be able to find romance between an addict and a former addict ? In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.

I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was. It was a very good book, even through its dark moments and because of its dark and raw moments in time",0

"The factory ""calibration"" differs dramatically on these. I got two and both display very different colors. Even with adjustment, they are still different. Maybe it is the backlight on one of them. Nice thin bezel. 100mm VESA mount. Got both mine for 119 and 6 months apart. Don't overpay. No ghosting.

Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape.

"Alpha werewolf Yeager stumbles upon his mate during a biker get together in a small town.  Theres just one problem: his mates just a child.  So he resigns himself to waiting for her to grow up.  Years later, he returns to claim her, only to find that his arch-enemy has also discovered his mate and wants to destroy any chance Yeager has for everlasting love.

The idea of a werewolf finding his mate when shes too young is a new one for me, and I enjoyed the twist.  It also added a dimension to Yeagernot just that hes a good man, willing to wait, but also that when he shows up years later, hes been yearning and lonely for her all that time.

The addition of the rival wolf and the extremes he goes to to keep Yeager and Cassie apart gave the book a lot of tension.  AndI won't reveal any spoilersbut the ending is a whole nother twist that I didn't expect.

"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system.
I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.

PERFECT. VERY STURDY. CHILD PROOF. Not an easy case,1
"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.",0

"I've always enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Ghostwalkers, that being said I've fallen in love with the Shadow Riders. This series promises to be a refreshing new world full of sexy alpha anti-heroes, strong women and an amazing cast of secondary characters.

Stefano Ferraro is a ruthless alpha who is in charge of his family business, some legal and some not so much. Stefano is the utimate alpha who claims his mate as soon as he finds her and will do anything to protect her.  Francesca Cappello is my favorite type of heroine, she is caring, giving, fiesty and doesn't let the hero run over her.  Their attraction and chemistry jumps off the pages, their emotions beautifully written, I fell in love with both of them.

I have a strong feeling that the mystery, intrigue, emotions and off the charts chemistry along with the incredible world-building the Shadow series will catapult this series to my favorite of Ms. Feehan's series.

Give Shadow Rider a chance, even if you don't care for paranormal, it's a book not to miss!

It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel like I'm wearing a wallet. I love the color and the wallet is very well made. I like the way it looks on my wrist and it's pretty strong. It's very soft and very comfortable. I'm very happy with my purchase.I have a wide foot and these boots were not just for me.  They are very comfortable, and they look great with jeans.  I bought a size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly.  They are very cute.  I am a size 5.5 and these fit great.  I have a narrow foot and these are perfect for me.

"This watch is my second pair of the same watch. I will keep this one in my collection.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and a size 8.  I ordered a size 11 and the fit is perfect.  He will be wearing this watch all winter long.  The only negative I have is that it is very cheap material.  I am hoping the price will be higher, since he is a size 7.  Otherwise, it's a great watch.  The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot wear it with jeans.  However, it is not thin and thin enough to cover his entire body.  It is light, but very cool.  I have a size 8 and ordered a size 10.  I am hoping the price will go up a bit, since the band is a bit small and the band is a bit short.

I had to try on a few different sizes, but ended up settling for a half-size down from what I usually wear. When you try them on, keep in mind that they're going to be almost uncomfortably tight. Give it time. I wore mine for a full day, then when I put them on the second day, they stretched enough so they slipped on my feet, and they're perfect.

I use mine in my medicine cabinet to organize my plethora of travel size soaps and sample products until I am ready to use them. I would also aggregator office supplies like post it's, binder clips and other similar items. It's made from clear plastic and has nice smooth edges and a very level bottom. The sides have a low profile that  make it easy to access items even if on a shelf. I have found its a great nail polish caddy, and for makeup items and since it fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer I will be purchasing another one or two.

Due to the size of the three compartments, its not the best for skinny items that tend to tip over, like gloss, mascara or brushes. It looks now certain enough to use on the counter, but isn't quite big enough to efficiently store perfume bottles.

Overall I like it and would make interdesign my new go-to brand for caddies.",0

Like I said, my daughter takes her pups everywhere and sleeps with them each night. She has had this pup for almost a year and it is still holding up great! She's pretty dirty, but with a little cleaning she looks as good as new. I always spot clean her with a little water. I am impressed with the quality of the materials. I am shocked that they have not gotten holes! This makes the price a little more worth it!

"This real life story has some interesting characters.  The characters are believable and the story is full of surprises.  This is the story of a young woman who goes to a very large college with a beautiful older man in a dress.  He wants to be an excellent teacher and teaches the people in his class how to do it.  He spends the first half of the book in a different college town, but then goes to another college.  He goes to college in a different town and his father is a college professor.  He does a very good job of teaching them how to do it.  They learn that there are some things that are not true and that there is something wrong with them.  They learn to deal with things like this and they are not happy with it.  They also learn that the people in their class are not happy with the teachers.  They don't really know what to do with themselves.  They are unhappy with the people in their class and they are afraid that the people in their class will say something that they don't like.  The real life story is more about the people in their class and how they deal with it.  It's not all about the teachers.  It's about the people in their class.  The book starts out very interesting, but then goes downhill and you end up with a lot of interesting characters.  The story is a bit slow and the characters aren't really believable.

"3.5*
This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail.

The goggles are awesome and so cute.  They look like the ones my daughter uses.

This set can be used with any 18 inch size dolls.

This will be a Christmas gift for my daughter so I hope to take another photo when it is all together but it comes separated in white box with no picture or markings other than to say it is a scooter. Perfect for wrapping.

My daughter is going to love that it has a helmet and Goggles. She was just talking about a pair for her dolls.

Pros:

Well made thick plastic
Easy to put together
Fun colors
Great Price
Quick Shipping

Cons
The box should have some advertising on it. It makes it appear cheap but the set looks anything but cheap.

It fits perfectly in my bathroom and he is very happy with it.I'm a huge fan of the color and the quality.  I've had a few of these and they work great.  I have no complaints about this.  They look great on my sink and the color is just right.  They are easy to put together and I am very happy with them.  I'm happy with the color though.  I don't like that they are so small so I can't fit a large mug of coffee in them.  I'll probably have to order more of these to have a nice look on my sink.  I don't know if it will work in my bathroom but I'm sure I'll have a nice mug of coffee by the time I get home.  I love the color and feel of these and would definitely buy them again.  I'm giving them five stars because they're very good quality",1
"Ordered this black faux leather chair for my desk-top computer.  It is wonderful to sit in--comfortable, can adjust to my 5'9"" frame.  I sit for hours sometimes & I don't get back pain or other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair.",0
"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products.",0

"This historical review of Elisabeth's history as Queen was nowhere near as gripping as her historical novel describing Elizabeth childhood.  Obviously, a real history cannot exhibit the same twists and turns that you can put in a factually-based novel, but this book focused far too much on Elizabeth love life (or lack of it!)  rather than the details of what was a highly political period.  A good read, but not an enthralling one.",0

"I have another cast iron square grill from Calphalon(?) and after comparing the two I gotta say, Lodge is a lot nicer.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use.",0

"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans! I don't care what color just get a pair before these sell out. I may buy another color myself. I tried to get a shot of my ass in but it wouldn't download! If these make a 65 yr old old lady look good- you'll rock them!",0

Sometimes situations in our lives are not always the best. I will admit that I have been tempted to give this book a try but I think that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. It is still a good book and a good one. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were strong and likable.,1

"This was a fun, clever book. I was leery of an indie title, but this one was better written/edited than many. This book gives you the perspective of a group of people playing a dungeons-and-dragons-type game, as well as the characters in the game (the NPCs, or non-player-characters). I'll admit as I was reading the book, I at first thought he spent too much time in the characters and I wanted him to ""pull back out"" to show the people playing the game; but in hindsight, he balanced it just right. He wrote it in such a way that keeps the reader guessing to figure out which characters are truly NPCs and which ones are being ""played"" by the people in the real world. The characters were all well-developed. The writing style was simple and easy to read, sometimes feeling much like a D&D module, but adding in enough of the feelings and motivations of the characters to make them feel more real. I would recommend this book, especially to those who have ever played D&D.",0

But when the family reunites at the new Foxworth Hall of course tragedy ensues.

He's a good guy, but he's a bit of a jerk, so I will probably never get to know him. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the next one.

"I was looking forward to receiving this robe. I appeared to be what I was looking for (except color). Unfortunately it won't do. The robe tie is woefully too short. It is so small that it just makes one tie and comes undone easily (!), can't have that now, can we? After two washings, it is starting the unraveling at the sleeves. Not much, but it does make me think this will be ratty looking in a year or so. It is lightweight which is nice for Arizona but not the softest material I've experienced. I have just ordered a bathrobe from another company and with hope, it will be what I was looking for.

"This is an ambitious, grand sexual adventure set in Arthurian times. Ambitious because Arden takes on myth and has managed humbly to make them human. She doesn't sell out her characters in favor of spending valuable time describing or focusing on the universe, nor does she in ore it completely. I was astounded by Arden's fluency in historical detail, not to mention the authenticity of the gay male sex acts.

"At first I thought there was something wrong with this game.  After a couple minutes I realized the game can sense your hand movement behind the buttons also.  The trick is to not move the hand that you are holding it with or it will read a touch.  The game is so sensitive it can read your hand just hovering above the touch panels, and quite accurately.  After learning the trick I like it very much because you can light up the pattern much quicker than the old games.  The slide game works quite well.
The only thing about this game is wasn't crazy about is that I like classic Simon and the game will only use the left side of each color, pressing the other side will result in a buzz and lost game.
Overall I would say the the game is an improvement over the old hard press Simon games.",0

"I was really surprised at the size and weight of this watch! I got it for my son who is very athletic, but he's not a big man! Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate. But with the INVICTA name, I'm not surprised.

No review of this watch would be complete without mentioning the packaging! You'd expect something like the Hope Diamond to be packaged like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invicta-Men-s-6566-Subaqua-Noma-IV-Collection-Chronograph-Black-Polyurethane-Watch/dp/B004PJ1J4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invicta Men's 6566 Subaqua Noma IV Collection Chronograph Black Polyurethane Watch</a>&nbsp;comes in a jeweler's quality, bright-yellow box with a hinged lid and... Oh, it's just too lovely to describe... I hope you can get this and see for yourself.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

"We've all heard the premise before, we all know how it's going to end, but few films take us on such an marvelously silly ride as 'The Other Guys'! This film is played completely for laughs and at no point do you think anything happening is real. It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film. If you're in the mood for supreme goofiness, then 'The Other Guy' will have you laughing hysterically, but if you don't like silly films, then this one might leave you scratching your head.",0

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman. The way the characters grew to know themselves was wonderful to watch and resonated with the reader.

Well worth the read.",0
"Once an architectural historian, I have a weakness for books about architecture and/or renovation projects. So I had great hopes until I started reading this one. It was quickly apparent that the author knew very little about buying, renovating or even owning such a building, and since that was the scaffolding on which the story was to be told, the book lost my interest. There are good architecture books, by, for example, Lindsey Davis (a Roman villa in Britain) and Ellis Peters (a great cathedral). This isn't one of them.",0
We have multiple iPads with different movies and TV shows on each.  With the iPad storage limitations I had to pick and choose periodically to remove and add movies.  With the Seagate Wireless everyone can watch whatever they want.  I copied almost our entire DVD collection as well as our iTune movies to the Seagate and now there's never a shortage of something to watch.  I have a 6 year old daughter and entertainment on the go is a must.  We also connect the iPad to our T&C van and watch movies stored on the Seagate on the car DVD screen.  The picture is not as crystal clear as when a DVD is playing but we're willing to sacrifice a little clarity.  We recently went on a short (maybe 1.5 hour trip) with 5 kids in the car ranging in age and this was a life saver.  The kids could hear and see the movie perfectly.  Have you ever tried to watch 5 kids try to listen and watch a movie on one iPad?  It's not a good thing.  The Seagate makes it possible to give choices on what movie to watch and I carry it with me everywhere now.,0

They had no arch support, which is a plus for me.  I ordered a half size up, which is a good thing because I'm getting older and having trouble getting shoes to fit.  I'm a 42D, so I'm on my feet all day long, so I don't have to worry about arch support.  I've had these for about a month now, and they're still really comfortable.  I do recommend getting a size up.  It's not just that I like these shoes, I also like the color and the way they look.  I will be buying more pairs of these shoes soon.Love the design of this shoe.  It is pretty.  I wear a 9.5 and I ordered a 9.5.  I normally wear a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit very well.  I have wide feet and this shoe does that.  It is a little bit snug in the toe box, but I think it will fit well.  I would recommend this shoe.I ordered this for my daughter.  She is a small girl and it fit perfect.  The length is perfect and the color is beautiful.  She loves it and wears it everyday.This is a nice shoe, great fit, good quality and very comfortable.  I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs.

"This is one of the best books I've read this year. The story is compelling, the characters excellently written, and it deals so very, very well with the intrinsic power imbalance in any relationship involving slavery.

The romance is a slow burn by necessity, but is very much secondary to the storyline until it's really thrown in James' face what he's been doing all this time. Watching him have to re-evaluate everything he's understood in his life and slowly struggle with new insights (and that he might not be as good a man as he's thought) is the real story of the book, despite the high fantasy surrounding it. And it's wonderful, staying compelling without dragging through too much navel-gazing.",0

"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!",0

It's made of very high quality and I highly recommend it for any girl who likes to play with toys.I got this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it!  He has never had a problem with it, but he is definitely enjoying it!  We've put it together over a year and he still enjoys it and we're using it for his ""gift"" to his brother.  He was able to play with it for almost an hour with no issues.  It's still pretty cute, but not",1

They are very comfortable, and I love the fact that they are made of a hard plastic. The material is very soft, and I have no complaints about them. They also come with a small pocket on each side, and a long strap that allows you to carry things. I have to say that they are very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone. They are great.

It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes.

"Damien and Nikki are happily married and living life in domestic bliss. Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.
We also got to, briefly, meet Jackson Steele, who is the first character in the Stark Universe series, which is coming out Spring of 2015.
Overall, another wonderful chapter to the Nikki and Damien story.",0

"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure). It's heavy duty & hope it lasts for years!!",0

"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good.",0
"Elsie is one spitfire and she has the love of the Dragon  king's personal guard.  Their romance is hilarious and very public although they try to hide it.

"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have.",0

I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off.

It's a board book, so the pages turn easily and are smooth/shiny, so if your toddler goobers on them, you can simply wipe it down! The story is just about Elmo going to the zoo and pretending he's each one of the animals he sees.  It's a very cute book and we read it multiple times a day! The one complaint I have about it is that the edges of the cardboard have started to fray apart a little bit since we read it so much.

"I'm not an audiophile. My golden ears from yesteryear have tarnished rather badly.  I wanted a no-frills subwoofer to balance out my good-but-small bookshelf speakers. The first of these units arrived damaged: the grille had sheared off and could not be reattached. The company was perfect. They told me what to do and sent a replacement unit with no complaint or hassle. It came quickly. The instructions aren't the very clearest, but it didn't take long to figure it out and set it up. One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like. The other speakers are routed through this unit, which ostensibly leads to better balance. Can't prove it by me, but the result seems fine.",0

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.

The drill does not have a 2-piece screw driver. I have had to use a second set of hex-driver bits to get the screwdriver to work properly. The hexdriver bit is well made, and looks great.

The drill is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built.

The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up.

Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.

"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II"".",0

I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;),0

"The popular British World War II detective series ""Foyle's War"" returns for an encore performance with Set Six and three new episodes set in the months following VE Day.  Michael Kitchen returns as Detective Christopher Foyle, still Chief of the Hastings Police Station but awaiting his relief.  Honeysuckle Weeks is back as Foyle's former driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, now demobilized with a new job and a new relationship.  Anthony Howell is Detective Milne, just promoted to head of the nearby Brighton Police Station and negotiating an unfamiliar relationship with his former boss.  The new episodes are excellent, with hard-hitting historical context.  Detective Foyle has lost none of his passion for justice, while the return of peace hasn't done away with crime.

In ""The Russia House"", the search for a missing Russian POW turns into a complicated murder mystery with national security implications.  Foyle must deal with the intelligence services, a White Russian refugee organization, and a shameful wartime secret.

In ""The Killing Time"", the presence of African-American GI's at Hastings triggers a spate of racial prejudice.  A crime attributed to one of the GI's turns into a complex mystery.

In ""The Hide"", a newly retired Foyle, awaiting a long-cherished trip to the States, gets involved in the strange case of a British traitor who refuses to defend himself at trail.  The details of the case connect to a murder and an unexpected skeleton in Foyle's own closet.

The ending of the stories nicely accounts for the series leads without foreclosing the possibility of future reunions.  ""Foyle's War: Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",0

"MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a review on my blog.",0

"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is.",0

The characters are not believable, and it's difficult to get into the story without getting into the characters.  This is a very good book.

I love how the author talks about the characters and the setting. I liked the way he explained everything.

"With a female cast of Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, Jessica Alba, and Taylor Swift -this is a guy's dream come true.  I'm sure the same goes for females with the male actors.  I can handle the occasional ""chick flick"", but this one just had a bad story with annoying characters.  Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time.  I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that.  The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a ""feel good"" ending.  I thought it was comical that someone as gorgeous as Jessica Biel could possibly be a frustrated single that can't get a date.  I don't think Jessica Biel has ever had to go without a date ever.  The movie has plenty of attractive people, but the movie itself is pretty bad.",0

"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke.",0

"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",0

The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)

"A waste of money, time and film. Not clever and not even funny. It's filled with over the top violence and vulgarities and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind violence and vulgarities if it adds to the story.
That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.

The balls were very hard to play with, especially if you have a little one who is about to age 4 or 5. I was able to use this set with a 6 year old.

"Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.",0

This product has been used for many years with dogs who will chew on anything, and this is no exception.  This product is very durable and is easy to put on and off.

"Indestructible is a dystopian fantasy that grabs a hold of you, thrusts you into a manic world of action and danger, and doesn't let go. And the moments where you've been given a chance to let your heart slow down don't ever last too long before you're thrown back into the action again.

Leah is a girl who loses everything when an energy blast rips through her town. Now taken in by a band of folks called Pyros, she comes to find out the truth about who she is and what she can do, as well as whom to trust and whom not to.

There is a lot of mythological weaving in this story, which I quite enjoyed. Adams does a nice job of simultaneously answering questions that pop up during Leah's journey and adding new questions as a result of those answers. I found myself wanting to discover exactly what happened in the past to bring this cast of characters to this point.

Many of those questions go unanswered, however, as the book ends in a cliffhanger, guaranteed to have readers anxious to grab the next book in the series.",0

"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read.",0

"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.",0

"I read this book at the recommendation of my mom who LOVED it. But, when I told a good friend I was reading it, her response was, ""I HATED it."" How to reconcile the two reactions.

I'm not sure if I loved it, but I definitely didn't hate it. The book is indeed, as some reviewers pointed out, plot driven. The reader is constantly wondering what will happen next. Will our main character die of a fever or step on a poisonous snake?

But I disagree with some reviewers who feel the characters were not well drawn. In fact, my mom and I talked about the book and speculated about what would happen next. We are sure a sequel is possible. That tells me that we liked the characters enough to see them again.

What was so remarkable about this story was the place. Set in the heart of Brazil and then deep in the Amazon jungle, the book gives a vivid and beautifully written description of place. Readers never feel as if the author has taken us away from the perils that lie everywhere. It makes me not want to visit that part of the world!

The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was the inability to believe certain things. I found myself coming out of the story (not good for a reader) and thinking, ""no way!"" First of all, would a pharma company invest that much time and money on a project and get no status reports, not a one? I doubt it. Would investors in that company allow it to do so? Perhaps for a short while but not for years. Secondly, what the strange and elusive Dr. Swenson was investigating seemed way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. I can't say what that was in order not to give anything away.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book. It kept me turning pages and wanting more. What more can we ask of a novel?",0

"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products.",0

"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

This story tells of the long road back to living by a widower writer and a librarian who has her own shadows.  The fact that they are each responsible for the life of a child plays well into the story.  This is a terrific read that will leave you with a smile.

"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth.",0

"I have used this for fine cracks in my drive way for about 5 years.  Some cracks take multiple fillings to finally fill the crack.  It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years.",0

"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.",0

"So, caveat of course - I did stop 1/3 of the way through the book, so it may well redeem itself later and come to a thrilling conclusion. I don't know, because I couldn't make it that far. Also, I think I missed one or more of the earlier books in this series. It seems like that might have been a prerequisite for liking the characters in this one, because none of them appealed to me. Mels, the heroine, was the most likeable but she still didn't grab me; she's stuck in a town she doesn't like and living with her mom and isn't doing anything about it. She's ""daring"" in that she doesn't wear a seatbelt, and nice in that she pays her debts and helps strangers in need, but that's about it. She's not striving for anything and has no greater plan of her own.

The hero and other male characters are all very JRWard-esque strong and uber-male and urban/gangsta, but not in a sexy way and again none of them really grabbed me. I wasn't rooting for anyone and wasn't worried about anyone. Unlike her Black Dagger Brotherhood series where the team is all about saving a community and innocents, in this series the cause (a fight between angels and demons) seems pretty self-centered. There may be some innocent caught in Hell that one of the angels is trying to rescue (again, must have missed that backstory in another book) but overall it seems the protagonists and antagonists are just trying to win a contest set up by the Maker in order to save their own souls.

Anyway - maybe if you read all the books in the series in order, and don't have any expectation of a good romance or quickly paced action, you'd enjoy it. I'll be skipping the rest of this series and waiting for her next.",0

I picked up this book and it was an interesting read. I enjoyed it very much and am looking forward to the next book in the series. I think this is a great book to read and look forward to the next book in the series. I recommend it highly!I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind. I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how each of the characters came to meet and fall in love with one another. I will definitely be reading the other books in the series. This was a great book. It was written in a very well written style. I will definitely read the next book in the series. This is a great series and I look forward to seeing where the next book comes from. I am always a fan of Julie Kingsolver's writing. I have read all of her books and have never been disappointed. She is a talented writer and this one was no exception.,1

In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes.",0
"The Partridge Family is a great nostalgic TV series about the trials of a Mother who to provide for her family formed a singing group.
  It is a bit odd that this group was chart toppers, but none really played their instruments, and only David & Shirley really did sing.
  From what I remember, David Cassidy did not want to do the series and did not enjoy it. So, Why did he agree to do it in the first place? It brought him fame and money, so he should have been grateful. I read of actors complaining and they have what most of us dream about. Sure their life changes as to security etc...but they will always be remembered.

I use this cube at least once a week and haven't had any problems with it.

My daughter took this into her room once and came back out with a few pieces that came off. It was easy to put them back on. I can only think she tried to force it when one of the sides was slightly misaligned and that's what led to the pieces coming off but I haven't had that issue.

"""Asking for Trouble"" is a happy, loveable, quick read, one that I highly recommend! It sure put a smile on my face.

Miranda O'Neill, a daycare owner, is in love with Cole Matheson, a wood carver, and he is in love with her. She walked away six months ago because marriage and kids were not part of his plan, something he was not sure he would ever want. Miranda, however, had dreams of a husband and family and she was not willing to give up on that knowing that in the end she would resent Cole. The physical chemistry is so strong that it is difficult for them to be in each others company without succumbing to the sexual pull between them.

When Cole's brother has plans to take his wife to Hawaii for ten glorious days, the babysitter becomes ill and Cole is pressured into keeping the 'demon in diapers.' When it all goes south there is only one person he knows that can help him...Miranda. Can she put her heartache aside to help Cole with the Tiny Tyrant?",0

These are incredibly comfortable and stylish (although the top is an elastic band, so I wouldn't recommend wearing with a short top)  I haven't been able to get rid of my mommy tummy and regular pants were cutting right into it, creating the muffin top and I was really self-conscious about it.  These pants stay in place and keep their shape really well, so I don't have to keep pulling them up and they don't stretch out while I'm wearing them, so no butt sag.  And they really do a great job of keeping my tummy looking flat, but without pinching.  These really are the perfect pants!  I'm currently a size 6 and I could have gone down to a 4 in these, so keep that in mind.  They have a standard inseam, but they're a little short on me, so if you have long legs, also keep that in mind.  I've recommended these to all my friends and I'll be buying more in the future.",0

"Installed these in a 04 mustang gt convertible, part of a complete tear down of the Mach 460 stock system. I used these in the front doors with an adapter replacing the 6x8 old speakers. I had to get a little crafty mounting the tweeters in the stock locations but they worked out.
 As far as sound goes the highs will make your ears bleed, mids are very nice, vocals and live music sound nice. I'd say if you like to hear quality in your music these will do that but if you like hard rock,rap or anything with needed bass response look elsewhere.
I paired these with the 6-1/2 model of these in the rear side panels and I can say they are better rounded and have tons more fuller sound. I'm thinking of replacing these with them in the front as well.
They are good filler speakers to me but wish they had more punch.

It is light enough and has a profile slim enough to sit in the pocket unobtrusively. I like the fact that you can open it via a flipper motion or by the thumb stud.

"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.",0

"My 3 year old enjoys many things, running, playing ball, he loves cars, he loves play food, play cooking and feeding the dog play food. (The poor dog!) When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it.",0

Great short read.  The characters were well written and the story flowed.  The characters were well developed.  Great job!I liked this book but,1
"I vaguely recall reading some articles by Mr. Safire, but I've never read any of his books before.  Well, I shall certainly remedy that.  If Scandalmonger is any sign, William Safire might just be one of the most able writers in the US today.
Seriously, it must have been six months since I've last enjoyed a novel as much as I have enjoyed this one.  Written with clear, powerful and well thought of prose (In the afterwords, Safire reveals some of the tricks that he used in order to convey the atmosphere without falling into the use of anarchonisms), this book is always thrilling and often witty, for those of us who enjoy subtle, sharp irony.
You don't have to reach the appendixes in order to realise the width of Safire's knowledge of the topic.  Safire is clearly very well versed with the history of the period, and it shows.  Not a very descriptive writer, Safire clearly knows alot about the personality of each and evry character in the novel.  Writing with a Historian's dedicacy, even Safire's lies are rarely more than half truths.
The Pacing and prose of Scandlemonger are perfect.  It is a page turner, very well written and planned.  Safire never lets his grip loose, and every word counts.
The parallels between the US of the 1790s-1800s and the US of the 1990s-2000s are overwhelming, and surprisingly, you feel some appreciation to the history of journalism.  I think it is impossible to read Scandalmonger without thinking about Monica Lewinski, but the novel will still be every bit as good when Lewiski, like Sally Hemmins, will be left as no more than an ancedote in US history.
I can not recommand Scandalmonger enough.  In each and every aspect it is a masterpiece of fiction.  In one word: TRIUMPH.",0

The only thing I can say is that the plastic lid is very heavy, if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to open.I was excited to get this set as I had never used one before.  I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has a very nice shape and the weight is perfect for my needs.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt my hands shaking, but I've never felt any hand shake or feel the weight on my hands.  I like that it's a little bigger than my other set.  I'm very pleased with the quality and the price.This is a great pillow for a few bucks.  It has a good grip, but it is not as good as a traditional pillow.  I don't recommend this pillow at all.  I have a few other pillow cases in my collection that I like and this is the one.  I'm very happy with it.

"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too.",0

Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option. Not sure I would buy again but it's decent enough to keep and looks fine in that space.",0

"Bought this since I needed a worklight that could run off batteries.  The unit is quite large and reasonably well built.  It gives off good enough light - not particularly very bright but bright enough to illuminate dim areas where ambient light will be available.  One thing to keep in mind that LEDs that are too bright can be a hindrance since they can be blinding reflecting off surfaces inches away where you're likely to use this thing.  Therefore this wouldn't be a great ""lantern"" in the event of a power outage, but instead provides balanced light in tight spots.  It does bend as well so can direct light optimally as you need it.  With the price in mind it's an excellent value worth every penny.",0
"This was my first real viewing (start to finish) of the movie. It's worth a watch if you've never seen it. Not sure if it's one to watch every year, however (as I do  the 1951 ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with Jimmy Stewart & Donna Reed).

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused. For me, the intrigue of this movie was less about Ralphie (the main character) and more about the eccentric father and how diametrically opposed the mother was. How in the heck did THESE two hook up? Given that, the movie takes a somewhat surprising but very warm, heartfelt turn - and you're left feeling that all is right with the world.",0

"This is an update to my previous one star review, after several e mails I was able to receive a replacement, led lamp and power supply as per Kathy at GLW, very pleasant person.
she reassured me of the fulfillment by GLW that they would stand behind their product.
I know sometimes units fail, and you do get what you pay for, but I am happy to let every one know that GLW will stand behind their product, this uni has a one year manufacture warranty. and they are replacing the parts at no charge.
thank you Kathy, now I am a happy customer.

I purchased this product 4 months ago nov 24,2016 the unit worked great very impressed very bright light but the LED's are very dim about 5% and pulsing.

but I cant find who to send it to or who to contact for repairs under the 1 year warranty.

"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A.",0

I have a 1500W oil lamp with the bulb on it. I need a 40W one. I am using the 18W bulb and am using a 75W one. The bulb is a little smaller than the 18W one. I have to replace the bulb every 5-10 years. I did get a 60W one from Amazon for $250. 00 and I will buy another for $50. 00. I have a 60W one for $2. 00 and a 75W one for $2. 50. I will be buying a 75W one and a 75W one for $2. 50. I bought a bulb from a local vendor and now I have to replace them every 5-10 years. This is a great lamp and a great price. I have no complaints about this lamp. I have a few other reviews that have the same problem. I have read a lot of reviews that mention how small the bulb is. I have been using it for about a month and it seems to be working great. I am now buying another bulb for $3. 50. I would have to order another bulb if I had a problem with it. I am now ordering another bulb. I hope it works great. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for several projects and it is good quality.

I thoroughly enjoyed this Poe-twist story line.  It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end. As in his (Poe's) books; the fast-beating heart, time ticking away fervently, and turmoil to keep you always on the edge of your seat, was done well.  At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash.  But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him.

"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean.",0
"""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is the last of Coelho's trilogy that explores the parameters of Good and Evil and their impact on the human soul.  In this story a stranger, battered and disheartened by the absolute worse that life can dish out, visits a small town with the intentions of carrying out an experiment aimed at assuaging some of his bitterness and pain.  While in the village, he enlists the help of Miss Prym who, bored with small town living, sees an opportunity for escape; but at what cost?  As the story unfolds the people of Viscos learn of the experiment and how they, collectively and individually, can benefit from it.  It is Coelho's interrogation of the villagers' intentions that provides the reader with a glimpse of the dueling forces of good and evil.

The novel is very well translated as I never felt that something was missing while reading it.  The language is loaded with meaning and highly symbolic.  ""Viscos is just like any other village in the world and whatever happens there happens in every continent, city, camp, convent, wherever.""  This is the wisdom shared with Miss Prym by Berta, the village's aged sage who spends her days watching over the village in an effort to see any evil coming.  I've always enjoyed Coelho's work and ""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is no different.  This is a solid story that's easily read and internalized.  Ultimately, what we learn about good and evil from this text sounds a lot simpler than I expected and much more easily articulated than done.  This is a quick yet profound read.  Highly Recommended.",0

This item is definitely not what the average-sized female would consider as a 1-size fit.  I am 5'7"", 36 DDD and have a long torso.  I started not to even bother trying it on because it looks tiny coming out of the package.  Once I had it on, I found that the elastic under the bust area does reach where it needs to and the stretch of the fabric didn't make it feel like it was too small.  It even reached far enough to cover my backside but wasn't long enough to wear into a public place such as a store/coffee shop, etc., after a day at the beach.  The material is soft, slinky, inviting and very comfortable, even despite the fact that I thought it was too small.  The colors are bright, vibrant and cheerful.  Despite the fact that it was too short for my long torso, there is a generous cut to the item which gave a nice flowy feel to it.  I'm keeping it to pass on to my 5'4"" daughter whom I'm sure will love it!  A great value at this price, especially for the right sized person.",0

If you like this movie, buy it.I can't imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD. I'm not sure if it would have had a great soundtrack or just a few crappy songs.  But if you like this movie, buy it.  It's a lot of fun.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.  The acting was superb, the direction was perfect, and the production values were top notch.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has never seen or heard of the show.  If you're a fan of the show, then this is the show for you.  And if you're not a fan of the show, then you will love this show.  I can't wait for the next season of this show.

Yes, it is cheap for the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,

Has Auto Shut Off when bottle is empty. Yes, cleaning to avoid mold build up is reasonable to do. I use white vinegar as a rinse.
Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and portable, takes up very little space!

There are some grammatical & typographical errors, which usually annoy me to no end, but the story was so compelling I was able to overlook them. There isn't a lot of sex - and what is here isn't descriptive, but the story has so much substance that you won't be disappointed.",0

"If you have read the book, you know the basic gist of it, and the reader will understand what's going on in the story.  The basic idea is to take the reader on a journey into the world of the mind, and then read it with an open mind.  In other words, the reader is going to get a glimpse into the mind of a person who is not a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  The book is very useful, and a good introduction to the subject.  I highly recommend it, and recommend it highly, if you haven't already.

"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5.",0

"I thought that this would be more of a baseball book, as I'm a big fan of the nation's pastime. However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force. And there's Luther Laurence, a black man on the run from the law. Even with all these cops around, only Eddie knows of Luther's past, and it is information that he uses for his own vile purposes.",0

"Elizabeth Hoyt is back in rare form with her newest addition to the Maiden Lane series. Having been a fan of hers from her first novel, The Raven Prince, I was delighted to pick up this newest tale of love, loss, and redemption. While this book is the tenth in the series, I am ashamed to say I have missed the last two or three, and wasn't confused at all when I picked this one up, so Duke of Sin can absolutely be read as a stand alone.

  Montgomery has returned from his exile with a score to settle. Hoping to gain redemption and ruin those who had wronged him, Montgomery ventures into a seedy underbelly. Bridget Crumb, Montgomery's newest housekeeper, has secrets and her own agenda. In a world filled with intrigue and never knowing who your friends or enemies truly are, Bridget and Montgomery find kindred spirits within one another. Only Hoyt can have this mysterious Duke find common ground with a destitute, secretive housekeeper who ultimately find their happily ever after.

  As I mentioned before, I had missed a few of the last novels. Boy, am I fixing this ASAP. Hoyt's worlds are just so nuanced and layered, and once you start it all just clicks. Romantic to its core, Hoyt writes unique characters, each and every time, which I adore. No cookie cutter heroine or hero, their traits and characteristics give you an insight into who they are, their motivations, and ultimately their fates. Gorgeously written as always, with plenty of sexytimes, romantic to the core, and just plain lovely, I can't recommend Duke of Sin highly enough. Just a great story, with fabulous characters, written in Hoyt's trademark wit, I can't recommend this book highly enough.",0
"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",0

The material is very durable and very comfortable to wear. The size fits me and I can wear it all day long. The fabric is very soft and elastic.

"This novella is a very good addition to the Nemesis Unlimited series. Ada has been given an assignment to gather evidence against an aristocratic couple. This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books.",0
"This was my first book by Holly S. Roberts, and I can say, without hesitation, I'm a fan!  Madison Abigail Kinlock aka Mak, is an ex-cop turned PI after a career ending injury.  Now her days consist of investigating cheating douche bags, but as she likes to eat, she has no choice.  Moon controls Arizona's largest crime syndicate.  Mak and Moon cross paths when both are trying to catch the same guy,  and set sparks flying everywhere.  She can't get over how absolutely hot he is, and he's decided he wants her.  After Mak finds herself in danger, she must turn to Moon for help, as she can't trust the police.  Will Mak be able to keep the blue eyed Moon at arms length the more time they spend together?

WOW!  I LOVED LOVED LOVED this story so much!  It started out with a bang, and I never caught my breath until I finished.  The character development is great, with secondaries that I loved just as much.  A fast paced, action packed, and very well written story line flows perfectly.  Holly S. Roberts does a brilliant job in weaving layers of twists and turns that kept my heart racing, at warp speed, cover to cover.  The well placed humor had me laughing until my sides hurt, and the sexy scene goodness is SCORCHIN' HOT!  I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity to discover this talented author, and I CANNOT WAIT to read the next book in this Hotter than Hell series!  HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",0

"I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.
Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.
When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.
Yes, Regina is my new hero and the foster care and child protective services system will be a better place because of her.

Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need.

We are not sure if he is a finicky eater or if he is a finicky eater.  It is a very small dog, and he eats about 1/2 cup per day, so this seems to be a good food for him.  He will be a finicky eater for awhile to come, but he will not eat this food any more.

"I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

I received these wraps at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thoughts so others can make informed product decisions.",0

"I have friends who are SCCA corner workers and others who are EMTs and Firefighters. Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!",0

"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

"It seems there have been a couple nasty reviews towards the particular gauge. However I believe most of them are regarding the fact that it does not handle Presta Valves very well.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.",0

""The Risk Pool"" is of nowhere near the same quality as ""Empire Falls"", ""Nobody's Fool"", ""Everybody's Fool"" or ""The Bridge of Sighs."" Having recently finished both ""Fool"" books, it was interesting to note the similarities between the characters SamHall/Don Sullivan and Eileen/Ruth and the towns of North Bath/Mohawk. It was almost as though ""The Risk Pool"" was a first draft of the later novels. All 3 books feature a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well major character, but he is so much more likable in the later 2 iterations. So, if you have limited time or patience and want to read one book about a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well in a dying upstate New York town, read ""Nobody's Fool."" It's fabulous, funny and endearing, while ""The Risk Pool"" is slow, depressing and boring.",0

"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new.",0

"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

"I typically read the negative reviews before I buy something.  This review primarily addresses some of the negative reviews.  I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.  I was weighed down a bit, but it worked great, particularly if one is traveling in a foreign country (very secure).",0

"We have 4 cats. They all seem to love this litter. They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY. Oh yeah, the light  litter does not track-out on the cat's paws and then onto the floor nearly as much as the clay litter. This makes my wife very happy.",0

The plastic part is a bit difficult to get to, and it takes a bit of getting used to.  This is a problem that I would not have to deal with.  I also have had to use a cheap plastic back plate to get it to fit.  I am not sure if it will be long enough to get used to, but if I get used to the plastic back plate, I am not going to need it.

"Tess Cole hates being outed.  She's a classically trained detective, and she has to do a lot of detective work, including the investigation of a possible murder.  Her job is to track down the murderer, and she's one of the most dangerous detectives in the country.  In addition to being a detective, she's also a cop, and she's also the one who got the death penalty for a murder that happened on a train.  When she learns that the killer is a serial killer, she decides to take matters into her own hands, and just in time for the murder to go unsolved.  Now that she has the opportunity, she takes it on a wild ride, and the result is a killer she can't believe can't be caught.  As a result, she's put on trial, and she's going to be the target of the killer's latest case.

"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

Her character, Romona was also the most useless character I have ever seen in a movie. She gives ""too stupid to live"" a whole new meaning. Her friend is being murdered, what does she do? RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"".

"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning

"In this movie George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, who has just been released from jail.  He has two goals--to rob three Las Vegas casinos and to win back his ex-wife (played by Julia Roberts) who is dating the owner of the casinos.  He assembles 11 men to help him and they are played by such crowd-pleasers as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould.  The movie is fun, slick and full of high-tech and low-tech gimmicks which help Ocean's 11 gain access to the casinos.  My biggest complaint is that Julia Roberts is miscast and underutilized as the trophy wife/girlfriend of the two adversaries.  However, if you can put that aside, Ocean's 11 offers an enjoyable evening of entertainment.",0
Terrible. Halfway through the plot is still unclear. The whole thing just needs help.,0
"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season.",0

"3.5 Stars, I really, really enjoyed this book. It is a super sweet romance and it just soaks in the couple time and we get so many phases of the relationship. Agh. Love it.

Aaron is completely sweet and well a wish fulfillment hero for someone as hurt and angry as Zack. Zack's voice in wonderful with great asides to the read and wry self reflection.

Aaron is a bit of a doormat but there is some nice conflict around making sure Zach and Aaron are partners in this relationship.

As much as I liked it, and I did, there are issues with the writing in terms of unresolved stuff,.

Aaron's relationship with Zach's brother and wife need to be discussed. There is so much co dependency in Aaron.

Zach needs therapy for his childhood trauma.

The plot pacing is sluggish so while even though I enjoyed it, others will be driven batty.
Aaron has no pets. He is a vet. We never get to see his love of animals.

And there is other weird stuff but I liked it anyway, A lot. lol.",0

"I'm the type of person who, when I find a brand and style I like, I stick with them. My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly. It was probably due to the frequent washings but I was having to replace them yearly.

So I decided to give Carhartt a try. I have recently switch to their jeans because of quality dropping in my usual brand and style so I decided to give these a try. They are strongly constructed and look good. Not as much room in the seat and thigh area as I would like but I'm getting used to it. Have been washed a few times and the color has not faded.

Some are saying that they feel rough and stiff. Well, yeah. Compared to my previous brand (which I will probably by for casual occasions and not need to was as frequently), these aren't very soft. But I was going for durable. While I work in an office, I do have to do some physical stuff. May I suggest using a liquid fabric softener. I always use it and have no problem with these pants.

Just remembered, I purchased these in blue with the same measurements. Even less room in the seat and thigh (meaning really tight you-know-where). Not sure what's up with that but I plan to get more in black and hopefully that was a fluke.",0

Writer/director Chad Ferrin (Someone's Knocking At the Door) is quickly establishing himself as a cult horror stud.  This movie is darn near perfect, melding violence, nudity, and touches of dark comedy with some very likeable protagonists and despicable villains.  Just some great writing, acting, pacing, characters, camerawork, bloody effects--this is all done in a very stylish, original fashion.

It's Easter time.  Mindy is the single mother of her 16-yr-old son Nicholas, who is mentally-disabled and has a hard time coping with the loss of his father.  When Mom brings home her new boyfriend Remington, the young kid instinctually puts up the red flag.  Then when Mindy leaves for work, we get to see first hand what a total scumbag this dude really is.  He invites over some prostitutes and other degenerate sleazeball buddies and the party is about to get bloody.  A mysterious killer in a bunny mask is ready to hunt, and it's more than Easter eggs that are going to dye.

"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.",0

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love.

I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story.

"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

This bucket is huge and comes with utensils such as molds and rulers and more than adequate capacity for play doh.  It's labeled as appropriate for ages 3 and up and great not only for storage but easy travel.  Like most toys it's made of rather cheap plastic so the only question is whether or not it's durable.  We will test it out over the next few months and see what happens.,0
"It's small (under 2"" side to side) including the diffuser and just over 1"" for the light part. Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information.",0

The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up.

"I've been using this monitor on and off now for a couple of weeks, and it's ok.  I've got it connected to a docked Lenovo ThinkPad, and so far haven't had any real issues to report.  No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great.
Pros:  Cheap, looks nice, LED backlit
Cons: No HDMI, low quality stand, brightness",0

Robert De Niro is one of my very favorite actors, and as I very much expected, he did not disappoint. I also loved Jody Foster, I have seen many movies of hers, and I also love her acting very much. I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind! If you haven't seen it yet and like, or at least tolerate, this particular genre of gore, I'm willing to bet that, in seeing these actors' work in their beginnings will show clearly and unmistakably the reason why they have become huge stars and received so many accolades.",0

The inside bottom sole of the right shoe is lifted from the bottom of the shoe and not fully glued on. I can lift half of it off. I'm nervous to wear these because I feel that the inside will get worn pretty fast and start sliding and coming out easily oppose to if it were made and glued down properly. I tried them on for a brief minute to see if the sizing was good and that was fine so no complaints there. Still not sure what to do with these. I'm really debating on sending them back but the process to do so from overseas is a little difficult.,0

"~

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

Way to go Amazing-zon!!!

Once I get an added amp for the components, I will see how they do with 200W, they will probably be able to handle more volume and distortion with more power available.

"These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.",0
"I also did not have the easiest time getting this watching working and setup to a display I liked. There isn't a display more that I like. I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.

"My best friend Kate, has taken anti-depressants for many years. She has seen doctor after doctor to try and find out why she needs this medication.
In reading this book I learned more about helping her than in many years past.
Since it was doctor diagnosed, it should be doctor fixed. Made sense to me. This wonderful book teaches you different.
Kate and I have begun to put to the test a few of the methods described in How To Be Happy. They have produced laughter and activity we were missing out on just a few days ago.
Sadly no doctor ever told her that laughter acts as a tranquilizer and a mood enhancer.
I wish I would have know how to help my best friend years ago. It has been a wonderful experience to see her come out of that deep dark place she has been in, even on medication, for so long. This book has changed both our lives for the better and I could not be happier. Dont think you have to have a sad friend to benefit from this book. You are given ways of making a happy life even happier.

Has a nice snap lock into place and since I wear mine with loose/stretchy waistbands, I wanted my draw to be loose as well. So I made it that way. Anyone can do it.

"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

I think the ending was better than the ending of the first film, and I would've loved to see it again. I was a little disappointed by the ending of the first film, because it was not as dramatic as the first film, but I would've liked to see the ending of the second film.

"We previously had the Tetra Waterfall Globe which was pretty, until the extremely thin glass shattered in my hands during a cleaning. So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

"I was so surprised by how large this actually is. My dogs love it. Packaging is great, but a little wasteful. I mean, this product obviously isn't going to get damaged, but it had a huge box and packing bubbles. The toy is really long and flat, no stuffing at all. It has three squeakers in it. SO annoying, but I buy them anyway because my dogs can't get enough. I love that it is so long because the dogs can both rough house with the same toy while they're playing. And little shards aren't all over the place like with the rope bones. The stitching and material must be pretty impressive because my dogs have rolled, wrestled and been nuts with this thing and it is still holding up after 48 hours. I don't think it will last the weekend, but it has already outlasted most of their rope bones and other toys. (Other than chuck it balls, those things are truly indestructible). Great fabric, great toy!! My doggies love it :)",0

"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.",0

I bought a size large and both pieces fit perfectly.  My son is about 5'11"" and 170 pounds.  Recently, he's had a hard time finding pajama pants that are the right length.

They have an elastic band, as well as a drawstring, so they fit a variety of sizes.  I personally think that the long sleeve t-shirt is a stylish choice for the younger male that doesn't want to wear a matching button up pajama top in the same print and it's a heavier material than a regular t-shirt.

I'm going to pick up another pair, most likely in the other color that's available, because they're such a great deal at this price and the fit is true to size.  These are a great choice if you're looking for a little gift for any male in your life.  The soft, fuzzy bottoms would also be nice for a woman.  Just make sure you check the sizing!",0

"Review of:  ""What Paul Meant""

By: Garry Wills

Paul was the first letter writer of Christianity.

His epistles are considered the most pessimistic writings of the early church.

Despite the pessimism of Paul's epistles, he guided the early church and aided the growth of the early church.  The author, Garry Wills, calls the growth of the early church an explosion of belief.  He says of Paul:  ""Paul was part of this explosion of belief.""  Garry Wills says that Nietzsche called Paul the ""dysangelist"" or the bad news bearer, and ""a man with a genius for hatred.""  This is in contrast to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the ""evangelists"" or the good news bearers.

The author asks the question: ""how much of this notoriety is deserved?""  His answer: ""very little.""

This book uses seven of Paul's letters: ""Letter to the Thessalonians"", ""Letter to the Galatians"", ""Letter to the Philippians"", ""Letter to Philemon"", ""First Letter to the Corinthians"", ""Second Letter to the Corinthians"" and ""Letter to the Romans.""  These are the letters whose authorship is not disputed.

Author Wills shows that Paul echoed and amplified the message of love spoken by Jesus.  Paul had the same message of love as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John when he reports on the teaching of Jesus.

This book also gives details of the life of Paul and of the history of early Christianity.

This book is a good amplification of the meaning of Paul's letters.  It is clear and easy to understand and the reasoning is very sound.

"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.",0

"This lamp is very basic. The warning label was designed for the older style incandescent light bulbs. That is out of date. The shade is too short to accommodate the longer twist fluorescent bulbs. The twist bulbs produce less heat than the older style incandescent light bulbs. A 60 watt maximum for incandescent light bulbs, which produced a dim yellow light and lots of heat, is too limited. The electric cord had a long ""flag"" label wrapped around it, with an admonition to not remove it. Ha! Right! I'm going to leave the stupid label to interfere with my using the electric cord, safely! Time to design a lamp for the modern bulb, fluorescent or LED. Otherwise, this lamp provides a convenient but basic light.",0

"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales.",0

The rubber treads do improve the grip on the ball tremendously.  My six year old nephew prefers using this ball over his old orange basketball.  The only problem is that the ball is black and we live in Florida.  The ball collects heat fairly quickly and if the ball is left out, forget about playing with it.  Too bad they couldn't make this ball in the typical orange rubber so that it wouldn't get so hot in the heat.  Other than the color and how hot it gets in the sun it is a very good basketball.",0

"I have been waiting for this book and am very excited for it. This is the first book in a series and the first I have read by this author. This book is packed full of action, suspense and romance. I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review. I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I could not get into the book. I am glad I did. The story itself was not very interesting, but I felt it needed a little more development. I am not a huge fan of the hero and heroine, but the book is mostly about the next chapter in the series. It is a fun little mystery that will keep you wanting to read more of the story. I would recommend this book.

"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",0

"Viperine is daughter of Stheno, gorgon sister of Medusa and Euryale. She is Deuces cousin. She is Beautiful!!

She wears a loose fitted dress which exemplifies her hippie boho chic style. On her feet are detailed boots which have little fangs on them.

"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",0

We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...

This movie will NOT disappoint you! It was an absolute GEM of a movie!!!
Although we saw it in 2d, it was visually STIMULATING, with STUNNING effects, action sequences & characters!!!
All the characters, scenery, and animation were Simply AMAZING!!!
Not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit & each voice over was clear and accurately defined!

Now for the story...
It was a well written story with built in Humor, loyalty, friendship and love!
A story that kids of all ages & adults could follow & believe in!

There is something in this movie for Everyone that watches it:)

If you have children, take them to see this movie ASAP... it is the perfect time of year, and will add to the Holiday Spirit...
If your child, ask your Parent or Parents to take you to this movie...
If your an adult, go see this movie... it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled!!!

After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down.",0

"This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside. This is not a toy your dog could play with inside if you were doing anything requiring your puppy to be quiet.",0

"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.

 Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.

Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.  Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg.",0

The author seemed to be trying to get the reader to love her characters. The writing style seemed a bit too choppy and choppy. There was a lot of dialogue and the story didn't quite get to the heart of it. It was like a well-written story that was written in a very short time. I liked the ending and it was nice to see a hero come back and save the world. The characters were too likable and the story was just too much like a story to me. I loved the ending and didn't like the ending at all. I don't know if I'd have read it again if I wasn't so absorbed in the story. I really did like the ending. I read the story for a week and it just did not seem worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. I've read all of the James Patterson books.

The item works well and the cling is good and fairly stable. It won't cling to everything though so keep that in mind and instead use a small piece of electrical or duct tape if you need to. I use this mainly for some electronics devices connected to my bedroom TV but also for my large blue LED alarm clock and it works great. I have only had to readjust it once or twice in 6 months.",0

"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

These shoes were far to small. The wide width is too narrow. The shoe is a bit short. If you are a size 8 or 10 then the shoe is a tad long. The color is a little darker in the picture. The size 9 is very nice. The shoes are comfortable and a bit stretchy. I did get a size 10 and it fit perfectly. I'm very happy with them.,1

"Wow!  Sometimes a great book comes along that grabs you and you can't stop thinking about it.  The his is one of those books.  Give yourseld time so you don't have to put it down.
Violet is recuperating from a serious accident that killed her fianc and left her badly scarred.  Her favorite pastime is ogling her sexy and very hot neighbor, as he repairs his roof.  When he falls from the roof, Violet rushes over, only to find him sprawled on a trampoline.  Making sure he's fine, he admits that he knew that she had been watching him, and wanted to meet her, figuring this was the only way it was going to happen.  For the first time Violet wants to let loose, to be reckless, something she's never had the courage to do, as the future CEO of Walker Construction.  She wants Noah, that is no secret, but she can't let him see her scars, so they embark in a just sex relationship.  How can she do this without baring herself.
When Noah sees his sexy neighbor watching him, he pretends to fall off the roof, hoping that she'll come over, so he can finally meet her.  Noah knows that Violet is hiding something since she only wants them to use their first names, and why is she always wearing scarfs when it's not even cold out.  As they get to know each other, they both start having feelings for each other.  However, how can they go forth when she doesn't trust him enough to reveal herself and her secrets.
This wonderful story is about hope, love and realizing that when you find true love, nothing can stand in the way.  I received this as an ARC from the author for an honest review and this is as honest as it gets.",0

The outside is a bit rough. I was worried it would be rough, but it's not. I will probably get a different color and finish. I love this product. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating. I'll be returning it. The color is true to the picture. It's not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as bad as I expected. I love it. Works great. Easy to use.

I got sucked in very early on and started to love this book. I read it every day. I had to read it again and again to find out what happened. The story was well told and the characters were strong.

"I loved this book.  I truly enjoy historical novels and Erik Larson does it better than most authors.  As he did in Devil In The White City, Mr.  Larson combines historical fact and fiction together to create a heart warming  story.  He has a way of keeping the reader spellbound until the last page.  His handling of President Wilson's frame of mind, the beginning of submarine warfare, the European allies and Central Powers ground forces, etc. never got boring.  His description of life on a submarie was so real I felt confined and uncomfortable sitting in my own living room.  It was a real page turner.

I have read all his work and consider him one of this generations better authors.",0

I would recommend this mat to anyone looking for a mat that is comfortable and easy to use. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a friend who has a pack of this that he keeps in his truck. We bought a second pack of this for his and we both love it. It is a little uncomfortable and I had to go back and forth to put the pack on. I'm happy with the purchase.",1
"A truely enjoyable read. A fine young hero with a strange, but strong moral code, amusingly turned from a remorseless cold blooded killer to a hero with a few misheard garbled dying words.

"Well I have to say, it's a very comfortable collar.  My dog loves to scratch.  The clasp is a nice design.  The dog is tall so it's easy to put on and off.  The clasp is very sturdy.  I don't have to worry about getting a bit loose because I can keep it on and off and on with the leash.  I love the fact that it's a little bit big for my dog and a little wide for her.  I also like that the clasp is adjustable so I can adjust it without pulling the dog.  It's also easy to adjust the collar so it fits nicely in my hand.  I love the fact that it's lightweight and I don't have to worry about pulling my dog's neck.  I've worn it a little longer than I thought it would be because I didn't want her pulling on it too hard.  She's a very picky eater",1
"This device is a must have if you are in the reloading business/hobby.  I found this to be a critical tool to match up the bushings in my shotgun press.  Found it to be more accurate than my Lee balance beam.  Very easy to calibrate, and use.  Comes with a 50g weight, a powder cup, small leather-like case and instructions.  Will be using it more and more as I get into reloading pistol and rifle rounds. Small and does not take up a lot of space.  The same scale in sporting good stores and other were much higher than this was via Amazon!

I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.

I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.

The nice thing is, even though I have 2 of them tucked into cabinets, they're good looking enough that I don't mind keeping them on a counter or desk.",0

She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.  This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.

I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.  I would definitely recommend this one. It's a cute story and I look forward to more from this author,  I hope Mike, Jonathon and Indi get their own stories!

"The whole movie is promoting BUDWEISER beer. Is it a lie that Budweiser is the only beer available?

The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

"This lens is such a huge improvement over the standard kit lens. When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable.",0
"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!",0

I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card... I'll update if I manage to find some kind of solution but as it is it is far from plug and play.,0
I was fortunate to watch the entire series on TV and I knew I had to add this to my library. I am a baby boomer and I can relate to a lot of the history that Oliver Stone presented.

"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set.",0

I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher.",0

"It's always hard to say goodbye to a  series and this one is no exception.  This 3rd book completes the trilogy of Last Survivors.

Miranda and her family are still surviving, just barely, and they are starting to realize that life as they knew it is truly gone and ain't coming back.  This isn't a temporary situation--it's permanent and that makes it more scary.  Some of the family seems to accept it before others.  Miranda's brother 'marries' a girl he only just met, realizing that their new life is too transitory for a long relationship.  Their home situation is getting worse and soon their very survival will depend on the youngest of them.

To make matters worse, Miranda's father returns with his new family and Alex, the main character from book 2 who is on his quest to find safety for his baby sister.

This last book was better than the second one, which I didn't love as much as the first one.  Miranda's voice is back but it is much more despairing and hopeless.  The love development between the Alex and Miranda didn't feel real--it felt very artificial and forced.  But, since Alex is literally the only boy around, maybe Miranda didn't feel like she had much choice.

I do like this series and while the second and third books didn't capture the intensity of the first one, it was still a great ride.",0

"I'm spending $22 on a chinese made medium sized microfiber towel because I'm about to start camping and be on the go and I want something that will dry quickly.  I could go to walmart and get a cotton blend towel for $3.00  It said to WASH the (blue) towel first as it 'could' bleed so I washed it in my sink and YES, it bleed everywhere...no harm done.

Why?  Because they aren't washing them in china, saves money and a step in the process = more profit for Sea to Summit.  Well, fine it doesn't bother me that much that I need to hand wash the towel.  It is amazingly SOFT and it comes with a cheesy mesh bag and has a cool snap loop to hang it, all great.

What SUCKS about this towel is that after I washed it in my hotel room (fancy hotel room with digital room temp set to 74 degrees) and rung out all the excess water it was STILL WET BY MORNING!  WTF!  I have been staying in this hotel for work for 12 days drying myself with hotel cotton blend towels and they are always bone dry by morning.

SO, the towel is going BACK!  What a rip off.",0

"I have had my press for a couple years now and I have never had a problem with them.

I had a similar press before and it seemed to work well. I used it with a small square of paper towel in a coffee pot. This one seemed to work well for the purpose.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have a few of these on my counter tops that are very easy to press and have worked great for a few years.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have not had one to break on the counter top as this one does.

I have not tried the coffee pot and I would have loved to have had a little more of a plunger on my counter top.

I would have preferred to have a plunger on my counter top.

My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose.

I would have preferred to have a slightly tighter handle.

"This was an illuminating biography of a real boundary breaker.  Francis Perkins, whose politics leaned a bit further left than I personally stand, was nevertheless a thoroughly impressive female leader in a setting where outright hostility and malevolence based on gender alone was not only accepted but seemingly encouraged.  Ms. Perkins' sublime way of sidestepping blustering male counterparts and outwitting (and outworking) male adversaries whilst earning stolid loyalty and respect from open-minded men of the day remain admirable and shocking to a woman born in the late 20th century.

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

"When Chief of Police at Painters Mill, Kate Burkholder was called in the early hours of the morning to the Amish bishops home, she certainly didn't expect what she found. Accompanied by her partner, Agent John Tomasetti they discovered the bishops wife cradling a newborn baby in her arms. The bishop had heard knocking at around 4am and when he opened the front door and found the basket on his front step, he was shocked. But the baby girl seemed healthy and was obviously only a few hours old  she was wrapped in a quilt with a wooden rattle beside her  both of which Kate was sure were Amish

With few clues to help them out, Kate began the search for the mother of the infant. But would she find her? And what would be the story behind the abandonment of a healthy baby girl  why would anyone do such a terrible thing?

"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable.",0
"In comedy, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  Subject knowledge comes in a close second.
George Burns' decades of entertainment experience allowed him to master both both aspects of comedy.  Whether working alone or with a partner (Gracie Allen, Walter Matthau, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire, Brooke Shields, etc...) George often slipped bits of wisdom in with his punch lines.  Sometimes those were the punch lines.  I could say he was at his best with this collection of TV Specials, but the truth is he was at his best each decade since he partnered with Gracie in 1923.  We can only be thankful George continued working after Gracie's passing in 1964.  The show did go on, and these shows can be enjoyed many, many times - good jokes, no matter how old, never get stale.",0
"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",0

"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.",0

I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story line, and the fact that they all had a very positive impact on the reader. I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job with the language and the plot. I think it would be great if the story line would have been more developed. I am hoping that the author will take this author to the next level. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more time to get into the characters. I love this series. I was waiting for the next book to come out. I love the characters and how the story unfolded.

"Reading through the reviews, people kept on saying about how the ""No more than four of any one card"" is a lie, but I decided to take a gamble on this anyway.  I am pleasantly surprised. I sorted through them, most cards are 2X, a lot of them are 1X, some are 4X, didn't notice any cards that were more than 4 of a kind, but I might have missed some.

Do not buy this if you are an advanced player that's looking for cards to use for tournament play.  Many of the cards are not tournament legal.  I personally like it better because I like to collect some of the older cards for their artwork. Some old cards date back to Ice Age (1995), 5th edition (1997) etc and range to the new ones like M11 and Scars of Mirrodin (2011).

I like to recommend this but remember you don't know what you are actually getting. They are mostly commons and some cards are old and a few are not in the best condition. If you are looking to expand your collection and adding more old cards, go for these!  Maybe I got lucky, but I'm very happy with what I got.",0

The case is odd, but I like it.

The band length is enormous, I have a 9 inch wrist and still took out four links, so if you have a large wrist you are in luck. Don't forget to get a link remover when you order this, one is not included. Tip: One side of the pins look like screw heads...you want to tap the pins out from the other side. There are arrows on the back of the links that also indicate the correct direction for pin removal.",0

Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.  The author, Danielle Hutton, is a wonderful writer.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.

"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.

We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.

It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.  The material is very soft and it's easy to tear off.  I've used it on my dogs all over the house and it looks nice and it's a little big for them.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this bedding and I think it will last a long time.",1
"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.",0

The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand.",0

"Fits perfectly into any existing train set but is even better as a starter set.

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

But even taking all that into consideration this is a great buy and I'd definitely suggest it as a beginning point for any child interested in trains.",0

"This is my first floodlight, and I am very pleased with it.  The light is pretty sturdy and well made.  I am using it in the kitchen, in a shed, in a closet, in the hallway, in a bedside table, and in my back yard.  It is a great light, and it has a very low profile.

"Ms Wylde does it again in this second installment of the Fairweather Sisters. I enjoyed reading it especially George (Lord Elmer's) antics.

I like how the author laces humor in this genre and manages to explain the difference between true love and infatuation.

Celine/Amy has her head over the clouds blinded by love when she loved those hideous poems. When she and George fought both of them made sense and I liked how they improved for each other.

Of all the places a duchess could give birth to, only Penelope could pull it off. Both Celine/Amy and George had brushes with danger and they always manage to get out unscathed.

"Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes.

This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas.",0

"hte fact that some parts of this movie may have a taste of surrealism to it (flesh eating bacteria,racist rednecks,mad dogs and those ever pesky horny teenagers) doesn't mean that cabin fever is a valid  horror flick. the actors are lame (WTF kinda name is rider strong anyway? sounds like a name for a porno star like boogie night's dirk diggler. ha ha)the story stole from so many horror movies, cliche's etc. and to top it all off what's up with the lame ass shopkeeper scene?? the near ending with the ""n"" word was done in piss poor taste. sure you have your garden variety racist @$$hole rednecks, but the ""payoff"" was meant to be humorous, but it wasn't, and who's the idiot that wrote the dennis/pancakes scene?!?  a karate kicking,androdgenous redneck kid who bites people? the gore was gratuatious but the specail makeup effects deserve praise. and to see the two actors from a good film like detriot rock city, have hit rock bottom when they signed on for this movie.
here's a slice of advice; rent a good horror film like freddy vs jason or underworld. pass on the indie horror flicks, especially anything from lion's gate who released crap like; house of 1000 corpses,May and this trash cabin fever. although ginger snaps was pretty good. and get this..lions gate has accquired ARTISAN, the guys that realeased the god awful HOUSE OF THE DEAD..oh boy.",0

The moment is always in balance with the strongest forces at play, and this movie reflects that somewhat... but mostly focus on telling the story of Confucius mastering the challenges handed to him. It's good Chinese historic stuff.

Be aware, when you start playing this DVD, it's in Chinese. You can add English subtitles, and/or switch to English dialog as well.",0

"To be honest when I ordered this I didn't have high hopes for it but I figured it was cheap enough and would be fine for listening to music while in the shower. I was immediately impressed with the appearance, it has some weight to it and is definitely bigger than I thought it would be. It comes with a few things to mount it whichever way works for you but I've only used the ring thingy on top to hang it on the shower hook and the suction cup a couple times. Now, the suction cup..I might be missing something but to me it doesn't seem to work very well at all and I don't feel comfortable leaving it suctioned on over water because it'll probably fall in and I don't want to test to see how waterproof it really is. It's really easy to connect it to your Bluetooth and it's way louder than I expected (SCORE!!!) The only other con I've found is that sometimes when I'm using it it'll randomly connect with my husband's Bluetooth and go silent. I'm actually not sure it's connecting with his Bluetooth or just interfering but either way it's annoying to have to keep reconnecting it. If you're looking for an affordable speaker that's good quality this is a great option.",0

I put the goggles on dry, then enter the pool. Gets kind of foggy maybe forty minutes later so I let it dry poolside and use my other pair. (I bought a second pair specifically for this purpose).

These are good recreational goggles although I doubt any one style could suit all wearers. It's different strokes for different folks. However, because of the reasonable price of this item I would have to say it's worth a try.",0

These pads are a great value. When I first installed them I almost did an endo going down my driveway not expecting the front to almost instantly stop me. Better than the OEM pads that came with my bike. Way better than the worn down pads these replaced. Thinking of ordering a new set as a backup.,0

"To everyone who surrounds Margo Roth Spiegelman, she is an adventurous, unconventional, and intelligent person and a highly admired someone that everyone puts on a pedestal. So when Margo sneaks into Quentin Jacobsen's room one glorious night and involves him in her crazy exploits, he can't help but feel as if a new page has been turned, and just maybe he can be a part of the marvelous Margo's life.

But the next morning all of Quentin's hopes are dashed with Margo's disappearance. Her parents and the police think this is just another one of her stunts, but Q's not so sure. Because Margo has left him a string of clues, one right after another, which just might lead him to her. But the thing is, he's not sure what he'll find.

John Green brings readers another surprising, witty, and fully honest book in Paper Towns. His writing is captivating from the very beginning as multitudes of details, no mater how large of small, flow seamlessly together. Green has a knack for highlighting the little distinguishing factors that make us human, making for more believable characters and completely enthralling book.

The mystery in Paper Towns is clever, and will leave readers scratching their heads as Q and his friends struggle to piece together the clues with some frustration and tons of humor. But the teens are just as quick to get serious as they contemplate what has actually happened to Margo and as Quentin especially comes to see her in a completely different light with a little help from the poetry of Walt Whitman.

Though Paper Towns did slow down a little bit in the middle of the book as Quentin hits a brick wall in his search, this novel is suspenseful, hilarious, and quirky, and especially appealing to the well read teen. The characters are as real as your own friends, and teens can't help but see pieces of their own lives in this amazingly candid book. Read at your own risk though--Green's works are completely addictive, and once you start, it's impossible to stop.",0

The drawbacks are its a little short length on the neck so you need a high collar to tuck it into and the portion that covers your nose squishes it badly. A little longer on the neck and just a bit more fabric across the nose and this would get five stars.

And, although it appears to function, and you don't get an error message, or maybe you do, you still are not going to get all you can, usage wise, from this terrific mouse.  It is a well made product.  Fits perfectly in your hand.  Allows you to set your DPI.  It can serve as a portable mouse, or as I use mine, a permanent mouse for my desktop.

"Lauren Oliver is a powerful writer whose prose punches the reader in the gut while creating empathy for the characters and building suspense. Panic does this in spades. It has a desperate, pessimistic, chilling tone that reflects the feelings of the main characters. Heather, Dodge, Natalie and Bishop know there is only a bleak future for them if they stay in their small rural dead-end town, but too poor for college and with no money to move, they have no way to escape. Participating in The Panic, a perilous and potentially deadly series of dares, offers a minuscule chance at winning a pool of money large enough to start a new life somewhere else. The very realistic characters are portrayed as flawed and sincere teens. They are rash and narcissistic, but loyal to a fault when it comes to looking out for the ones they love. Each has a different motive for participating, different plans for the money, and the determination of a mother grizzly. None of the teens is likable all the time, but none is despicable, either. The reader feels their deep unhappiness and hopes each will find some joy and optimism.",0
"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",0

"This book is largely a reflection of the fact that in the history of the art world, the artists have always had the advantage of a solid foundation in the art world. The fact that this book is written in the 60s, 70s and 80s, is a testament to the fact that a lot of artists have the ability to make a significant impact on the art world.

The book deals with the issue of the role of artists in the art world, and how artists can provide a positive impact on the art world.  The book is not about the art world, but about the artists",1

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

Also, for the price, there are very few train parts, and a lot of superfluous plain old dup.os.  Also, this item does not come with a track, although from the looks on the box, you might think so.

"This has got to be one of the smartes and most useful things I have bought in a long time!
I'm a older women that slid down my dirt driveway, and could not get up ( sounds like that commercial lol).my leg went back at
The knee and over..not fun, as the Dr.said..
That said I live on a few acres in the mountains in Ca., and my husband travels.
I bought this type of running belt to wear when I'm outside gardening etc. As I can put my phone into this.
If a accident happens Its easy to get to my phone.

My phone is a iphone 7 plus, as someone said there phone fit in this. It does,but its a tight fit!
I wear a size 10, and this belt with my phone in it, is not going anywhere. Very comfortable.
Fits great, and made well. The 2 zippers work good. If your a runner nothing is going to fly out of this,
And its Not in the way,of doing anything.",0
This is an awesome product! I got this because I was training my puppy to be okay with car rides and she was having accidents so I got this. Was thing this is a real pain because of the Velcro but make sure you wash on cold and gentle/delicate. I washed it like normal because it seemed so sturdy and nylon but the hems seemed to have shrunk from the warm/hot water. That was my bad for not thinking about the cotton parts of this.,0
great item just as described and a perfect addition to my collection,0
Perfect for everything!!!! Only thing that could make it better is if it were a sling backpack....,0
Surprised at the level of humor written into the story. Enjoyed it and will look for more of her books in the future,0
"They don't make 'em like that. The movie is just too full of action, too strong",1
"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book.",0
This tent is the best tent we have ever bought. We have even camped in a full blown storm with high winds off of a lake and it held up great didn't even leak a drop. Super easy set up. Built in liner so you don't have to worry if you can't get your truck bed spotless. We can fit a full size bed through the doorway so we use that instead of an airbed. Will use this brand in the future!,0

"OK first of all at this point I thought the author was a bit of a prude and I wasn't too impressed with the story.  The heroine was a bit of a golem with a bad attitude and in the end she was a bit of a loner.  The book had a bit of a romance going on between the two characters and it was a little predictable.  I just didn't care for the heroine's actions.  I don't think I will read more about her in future books.

Overall, I loved this story.  I just didn't get it.  It was a bit slow paced, but it kept my interest.  I'll be looking for more by this author.I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is",1

"I read this book and laughed and cried (and I am not a crier!) all the way to the end!

It is a great story with a mix of romance, of what might have been, what could never be, and the regrets we all carry with us through life.  It is about how life changes you and sometimes takes you on a path you may not want to be on, but nevertheless, there you are.

The heart of the story is Nella's love for a young man which she carries all through her life, and can never seem to come to terms with.

I am now a great fan of the author and can't wait to read her other books.",0

We bought another well known brand of cat food and these are the best!  I have one cat and two small dogs and I am always feeding them the best food. I can't go wrong with this. I am a loyal customer. I bought this for my dog who is a chewer and has lost the ability to chew. I had to start him on the traditional food after he had lost the ability to chew on his food. It's very easy to clean and his digestive system is fine. I will buy this again for our other dog who has a difficult time chewing and is having difficulty chewing on the food.,1

"I really like the games by this company (Gamewright). They have a whole series of short easy to play games and this is one of them. My four year old has been able to play this because it is easy and short and is over before his attention span is over. My eight year old has enjoyed this game and others like it by this company.

I'm not sure how educational it is, but I will say that it does help younger children with visual discrimination which is a prereading skill. Because this is a card game it is somewhat prone to being destroyed by young hands. However, the cards are larger than normal playing cards and very sturdy.

I would not hesitate to buy this game again. Enjoy.",0

It takes place is the beautiful city of New Orleans, and there's even Voodoo and witch craft!!! But they barely do anything with this! The first few episodes are good, but it just got bland! Very bland! I kept paying for the episodes, thinking that there is no way that this isn't going to get better at some point. It never does.  You have the opportunity to really use Voodoo and Witchcraft and historical New Orleans to capitalize on the creepy as in previous seasons of American Horror Story and then hardly use these things to your advantage in this season? Probably enough said.  My best advice? Wait and watch it for free!",0

"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

The plastic inside that you use to seal the bottle is a bit thick for my taste.  It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large bottle that you could get in the way.  I think it might be better to just keep the bottle with the seal.  I also think it will be a bit more difficult to clean the bottle if you have a large bottle with a larger bottle.  The plastic bottle holder is perfect for cleaning the bottle if you're using it for the purpose.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs a larger bottle.  It is definitely a better choice for keeping the bottle in the pocket.  The reason I like this bottle is because it has a lot of room for my phone and I can easily open the bottle and close it with the,1

"I was very excited to read this book. I have recently become the manager of a business and have been having a hard time trying to figure out how I should treat and deal with my staff. It's a small office and so we are have constant contact with each other and I have found it hard to strike the right balance between friend and boss. Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!

This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!

The author asked me to read and review this book and I am so glad he did. This is my honest review and I highly recommend the book.",0

But once I started spraying this, I ended up with a ton of it just running down the sides of the can.  So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.

The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that the main characters (the students) are just okay as actors.  The ROTC guy was the best.

"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far.",0

So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

I applaud Max for doing original research (interviews, etc.) and roughly half of the information in this book was new to me, but I feel like he should have spent way more time actually WRITING a biography rather than collating a bunch of letters and interviews without really analyzing his subject.  I never get the sense that the author is anything more than a mediocre journalist, or a member of a particularly active DFW list-serv who decided that he wanted to write a book---except that he didn't actually know anything about writing biographies.",0

It's the depth of interaction between client, client's inner world, and therapist that delights me most: the slow crumbling of defenses, the re-connection with inner truths, the breakthroughs, the increase in functionality.

"I love the P&P continuance stories and there are so few compared to the ""What if's "" that I am thrilled everytime I find one. This book did not dissappoint. Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot was plausible and so were their reactions.

Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other means of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid.

The story begins as they leave their wedding breakfast and the night does not end well. The next morning comes with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he tries to manage the escalating problems on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...

Really loved this book and would love a sequal to see how Georgiana and Kitty got along. Their stories are left hanging. And of course, I can never get enough of ODC...

Heartily recommend this book!",0
"Totally comfortable and perfect for use alone. I have had this and another pack of t-shirts for 3 months now and have washed them many times now. Have had no trouble with color fade and threads have not come loose in the wash as some other multipack, white t-shirts I have purchased from my local warehouse club. My wife and daughter also like these for night shirts as these are very large on them! I had to purchase another pack because they have claimed them for their own use.

I don't know about anyone else, but I have had a problem with my antiperspirant staining the arm pits. To solve this, I keep a bottle of Shout next to my laundry basket and spray the neck and armpit areas before tossing in the basket. Works everytime! Hope you find this helpful.",0
"In this story Sandro, has been caught up in a scandal involving a man who is the leader of the group. The story is told from his point of view and the consequences of his actions are revealed.

"Christmas season doesn't really begin to stretch until the very end of the series, and the whole premise is a bit too complicated to grasp, but it is the beginning of a great season. The cast is well cast, and the acting is top notch. This season is still far from being the best season of the series, and it will be the last season of the series. I highly recommend this series for anyone who has not seen it before. It was an interesting movie, not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The story is very well told and the action scenes are just right for a comedy movie. Good movie, great story line, good characters. This is a very good movie. I like this movie. I don't know if it's for the kids or for adults. I was a little disappointed in the ending. I hope that people will watch this movie. This is a fun movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves this movie. I can't wait for the next one. It was ok, but not very good. I guess it was meant to be a comedy. Great series. One of the best shows of all time. I loved it when it was on TV. I was excited to see it on Blu-ray.",1

The choices in this set are fun and clearly created for a girl, and they have instructions on how to create several options in the box that are easy to follow.

"Wow. This for me is just vastly better than War and Peace. Instead of trying to sketch the entire Russian world, here he focuses in on 2-3 interrelated families. The psychological depth Tolstoy creates for Anna, Vronsky, Levin and all the rest of these people is just incredibly vivid. You feel their insecurities and longings like they're your own. The dialogue, both internal and external, is fantastic, and each character feels so real, so totally brimming over with this little moments of honesty and pathos. And the whole thing is grounded in small sensory details which make this whole world come vividly alive on almost every page, whether its a description of a nightgown flapping in the breeze, or the sensations of a hunter walking through the woods before dawn. There's no end of life in this book. Sorry to gush so much, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best crafted, most perfectly balanced 'big' 19th century books I've ever read.

"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

"Arrived brand new, in the sealed package. They fit a standard Oly barbell, no problem. Initially they seemed a bit snug but after a few times off & on they work just fine. Make sure you flip it open all the way as it keeps expanding before sliding them on. My only complaint is after a few drops of the bar, they tend to slide but they've never come off and usually in between lifts we are swapping plates anyway. Worth the purchase just to have something there just in case.",0
"Wow! Now I know what happened to the characters!

I love how the characters are all so self-effacing and self-absorbed and the writing is so great. This is a book that I will be reading every year for years.I really enjoyed this book.  I love a good mystery with a good twist.  I have never been so happy with a book.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves mystery.I enjoyed this book.  I have read it twice now, and I have enjoyed it as well.  I was actually not sure if this book was written by a real author or if it was written by a fiction writer.  I was very disappointed.  I was given the opportunity to read this book only because I read it twice and I was really disappointed.  It is very boring, with no real plot.  It is not really a story.  I was just bored.  It was like watching a movie that was not very interesting and there was no real plot.  The main characters are boring, so you would think they would have been more interesting.  The main characters are not very interesting and I was not really interested in the plot.  I was not sure if this was meant to be a story or not.  It was really boring.  I just didn't like it.  I am a huge fan of James Patterson and this book is no exception.  I am a big fan of James Patterson and this book is no exception. ",1

"Attractive simple wall clock, runs time on the wall and is easy to read. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The clock is a great addition to my bathroom. It is attractive and I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago.",1
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced.  I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'.",0

"Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!",0

"From a play standpoint, this nerf blaster is one of the more fun toys to come out from them in awhile.  It has, to my mind, a bit of a HUNGER GAMES feel to it, resembling a cross bow as it does, rather than a gun.  And it's very cool that it shoots three streams of water.  Kids love that ""bonus.""  It's fairly compact, so it's great for a smaller child (7+, I would say) to run around and have some good, clean fun.  Nerf blasters generally feel relatively sturdy, but I have to say, this one feels even a bit more substantial than usual.  Good stuff...5 star fun.

But minus 1 star for the rather silly marketing.  The use of the word ""Rebelle"" (yes, a feminized version of Rebel) is silly, and even borderline sexist.  It's done in pastel colors, so of course only girls will like it.  And the packaging only features girls.  I'm just not sure this makes great marketing sense, and I'd like to think if I were running Nerf, we'd find a way to start making ALL our blasters / soakers appealing to both genders.  But this one is SO clearly marketed to girls that I can't imagine many boys in the toy store demanding to own this item...effectively eliminating nearly half your market.  Silly.",0
"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus.",0

Got these to give to my 8 mth old chihuahua who was diagnosed with elbow dysplasia.

"Nice, small size and professional appearance (for a backpack) if that is what you are looking for.  I have to agree with other posters though, the zippers are poor quality.  They stick and I have to straighten out the teeth to get them to work again.  Don't pull hard, just back up, straighten the teeth and try again.  Kind of a pain and I am concerned about longevity.

Update 8/16/16 - Just continued problems with the cheap zippers.  The backpack has held up well and the materials seem to be of very high quality.  But these zippers stink.  They don't work most of the time.",0
I am loving this author and this series.  I really feel the Lord is impressing him to write these books.  I really like him and I really like his series.,0
"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft.",0

"Jules Feiffer is characteristically hilarious in all of his books (like the Man in the Ceiling, for instance), however, this book is more than just hilarity. It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teaches countless lessons in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguises them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villagers who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up as an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their lives changed, and they thought less about vengeance and more about harmony.
Also, it has its funny points (which are many), but it is also despairingly tragic at times. I read this book first when I was 8, and it was just a funny book, but having read it again at an older age (16), I understand even more than I saw before. So, if you get a chance, this book is a must.

-UPDATE-

Hey Sorry, this is my real Review. I accidentally wrote the same review but on my Mum's (Deb) account below.

Sorry for the confusion!!",0
"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars). Stallone actually does some acting in this film. His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable. Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion. If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood.",0
I bought this on a whim for my son's third birthday.  He loves the music and the lights.  He is very happy with it and the game.

"I've never spent more than $100 on a pair of headphones before, so I can't really compare these to other high end cans, but I absolutely love the accurate, high quality sound reproduction of these headphones! Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience.",0

"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding. I really like that it uses 2 AA batteries instead of the button batteries some of the other lights use.  I also was happy that the batteries were already installed when I took it out of the box, especially since it came with no instructions.  This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright.
The only little complaint is that you do have to totally unscrew the mount to take it off of the bike, and the little metal cylinder kept falling onto the ground.  Since I don't plan to take it off, I am thinking of adding a cable tie to make it more secure from theft.",0

Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

"Cons:

I've tried to find glass containers that fit this bag, and have been unsuccessful except for the 2 cup Pyrex that only fits in the bottom ""shelf""

the side net pockets are useless when the bottle holders are being used- too tight

all the inner pockets are netting and pretty flat. would have been nice to have a space to store utensils.

there are loops for a shoulder strap but it does not come with one.

Pros:

the Bottle sections hold a large quart mason jar and a large Blender Bottle easily. the Nutribullet container is tight but it will fit.

the containers hold enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks and drinks. and has replaced all my other lunch bags i've purchased but just weren't quite right.

"I was asked to review this book, and agreed. However, I found it so incredibly useful that I bought a copy so it can reside on my Kindle. Crosby and Dobbins have written a comprehensive overview that helps take your book from I've-written-a-book-now-what to a formatted and marketable product. There are few (if any?) books that address ebook marketing in such a comprehensive manner.

I found the sections on marketing the most useful. What makes this material (and all subjects in the book) so valuable is the many links to sites to help you learn more. Since I periodically use KDP Select for free days, the lists of sites to publicize free books was of special interest.

The authors operate a site called Kindle Book Promo. While it is mentioned when it relates to a topic, this book is not an advertising vehicle for the authors' services.

I highly recommend Advanced Kindle Book Marketing.",0

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",0

"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all.",0

"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site.",0

"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book.",0

My only sort of negative comment is I wish the leather was of a heavier quality as I feel it isn't gonna hold up that long. Overall I would buy another one. It was a good purchase.",0
"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value.",0

"After receiving my Aircee  (Cordura) in January of 2014, I was excited to try it out. The design of the cordura is very attractive. I used it to make my own makeshift swim shorts in a pool. This was an excellent choice for me. I used it with a portable phone, a tablet, and a book. I also used it to carry my new Amazon Fire TV and an iPhone 6S with a camera attached. The phone is very light and easy to use. I love that it has a built-in camera and has an easy to use screen. The cordura is not as thick as a standard cordura and I would have liked a thicker cordura for my phone. It is also a very comfortable, low profile cordura. I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly.",1
"I am a big fan of the underrated, marvellously talented late Robert Lancing, so I collect his stuff.  And he did some wonderful B flicks that are B Movie Addicts delight.  My favourite 4D man is one of the best, but this one is not too shabby.
Joan Collins is head of a group pushing an island paradise resort - yet to be built - and Lancing is the pilot of the boat that brings in the latest boatload of suckers....I mean investors...to view the imaginary golf course and club house.  Only problem, refugees from THEM! are lurking in the woods making off with islanders and soon to investors of Joan's resort.  The effects are typical Drive-in B movie quality (but hey, I miss the old drive-ins!! When I visited Kentucky they would have dusk to dawn creature features and that is where I first saw this movie), but Lancing as always is better than the material he is given and makes this worth the ticket.
So stack up four of five our your best Vincent Price and Chris Lee films, add Empire of the Ants (and watch the wonderful and well missed Robert Lancing), pop a bowl of popcorn , turn out the lights and imagine you are in a car with a speaker hanging from the window.  Have your own dusk to dawn creature features.
Off to see if I can hunt up a copy of 4D man in DVD.....",0

"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.",0

"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!",0

"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing.",0

This book is a classic for a reason. Jane is a heroine the reader can embrace.  The writing is flawless; Charlotte Bronte can evoke such genuine emotion.  If you want a book that you can immerse yourself in this is it.  I'm not one to re-read a book after I've already read it but Jane Eyre is one of my few exceptions.  This book should be in every library.,0
"This show is incredibly funny! I am so annoyed I didn't give this show a chance while it was on TV, and I hate that FOX cancelled it.
But what is left of the show is all I really need because its a smart, super funny, random hilarious show!
I don't want to get too in depth with this review but I'll say Season 2 of the show is the best and that you won't be disappointed if you buy this complete series set.
Do it now!
I really hope they make the ""Arrested Development"" movie in 2009 as well!!
So do it. Click buy now. Let all your worries about the show go away and just get captivated in the mad world of the Bluths!

This book is so worth reading. The characters are well developed and the story is well told. The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the hero. I enjoyed this book,1
"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!
I'll keep buying these.",0

"On average, this reader consumes two or three books per week. Mysteries and thrillers are my primary areas of interest.  I used to really look forward to reading about the exploits of Dr. Scarpetta.  Ms. Cornwell appears to have become fixated on this micro genre since her book about Jack the Ripper.  It seems as though the author has taken this series to such a shocking and depressingly dark side that I will probably never read another book.  The Bone Bed is a disjointed series of interactions between the pathologist and her band of dysfunctional characters that never reaches anything like a conclusion.",0

Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character  building.

"Okay, so I finally got around to buying the tools. I did not need a screwdriver, but I had some old saws, and they were the best. I was very pleased with the tools. I used them to cut a strip of wood, and they worked great. The only thing I would change is I would not use the blades to cut a strip of wood if I could get my hands on them. I used them to cut a cut with a saw, and they were great. I would recommend this tool to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan. I have used them for a couple of months now. They do work well for my purposes. The only issue is that I can't see them in my ceiling. I wish they were the ones that look like the ceiling lights. I would definitely recommend this lamp. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design. They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to handle, and I like that it holds a bit more weight than the regular plastic handle. I don't have any problems with the quality of the finish, but it's a little tough, and if you're going to be using it for anything other than decorative purposes, it will not hold up to the use. I'm a homeowner and would definitely buy another pair. This is a very nice pair of LED lights, very bright. I have used them for a few projects and have been using them for a couple of days now.",1

"This was my first ever quadcopter and I pretty much was sure I would destroy it very quickly after opening it. I'm pretty blown away by this little beast because a) it flies really smoothly and is relatively easy to control, even for a beginner like me. and b) it takes a lickin and keeps on ticking! I've been flying this thing for about a week non-stop now with at least 3-4 total hours of flight time logged so far. (It only gets 5-7 minutes per charge so I've flown it like at least 30 times already) And I have crashed it way over 100 times already. And it has never sustained real damage. 4 stars not 5 because the props do come off REALLY easily and are easily lost. I put a tiny drop of glue on each prop and that has helped a lot. I also tried the Hobbyzone Faze (which looks very similar and has the exact same controller) - but looks are deceiving - this Estes thing blows the Faze out of the sky! The Faze was harder to control, and the Faze died within the first few flights. Meanwhile the Estes keeps on buzzing and delighting us. Yay, Estes! Love this thing!",0

"I caught a portion of this movie on TV and it made me curious.  I found some time to kill and watched.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good acting, and a bit of a surprise twist towards the end.  There were some major production/ storyboard/ screenplay errors.  Like when the units go to the field and the whole thing is cut short, it was a surprise, but the execution was forced and it seemed like a story rip-off.  That part of the story/ screenplay cheapened the whole film and left me feeling empty, like something was missing.  Overall a good film, just a couple of portions felt unfinished.",0

"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful.",0

So far, I've worn it with knee high black boots, and it makes a cute outfit. As far as what others think, from the moment I put it on, I received compliments from multiple complete strangers saying, ""I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you I LOVE your dress!""  Of course, that kind of reaction is always a plus. I have worn this three times already. It is very comfortable. It has been well-received both in the casual and professional executive work environments. I hope the blue one is just as nice.

Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....",0

It's very easy to open and close, and it's very durable. I love that it has a ""stiff"" lid to keep it from sliding open. The box has a ""cradle"" lid on the front, and it's well made.

It also remains faithful to the words and emotional feel of Matthew's gospel, and it captures nuances from the other gospels as well.

I bought this reel based on Alan Hawks review.  I strung this reel with 300Yds. of 100Lb. Power Pro. After fighting bull reds in the surf with this reel I have to say this reel is a tank. Exceeds my expectations. I would have given this reel five stars for price point but will need to see the reels longevity and durability to rate it that high. I will say everything Alan reviewed to be true. If  you have never fought bull reds in the surf Ill just say it qualifies for hard use. This reel is not refined but is very well made. I would trust it over my much more expensive Shimano reels for big game. The drag is unbelievable and can handle heavy tackle. I wish I would have bought two of these reels because now you cant find one and the prices have already gone up 20%. I REEEEALLY hope the quality does not go down on this reel because I believe Fin-Nor has hit a home run with this one. I fish this reel next to five Shimanos in the Texas gulf.,0

While a lot of the dialogue is quite good, much is long declamatory prose that explicates the character or the plot. The intricacies of the relationships and the exaggerations of plot elements became unbelievable and sort of silly in what was meant to be a realistic novel.

The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.

The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.

An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.

Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.

Wallace Thurman was an acute social critic, and his satirical talent is full strength in The Blacker the Berry.",0

"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.",0

"BLUE DAHLIA by Nora Roberts. My recommendation:

1. I will admit that I have been a fan of Nora Roberts' books for a while and have enjoyed her writing. I enjoyed this book and had no issues with it. If you are looking for an easy read, this is the book. I highly recommend it. I have read a few of her books and will continue to read them as I read them. The story line is a good one and will keep you turning the pages. 2. I liked the ending and it was not just a big cliffhanger but a real good ending. I don't want to give away anything but I found myself wanting to get to the end. It was a real surprise to me how it ended.",1

Even after his pit bull like gnawing, the train still looks pretty good, although you can see the indentations from his teeth.

"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.",0

The miracle is that from these disparate elements the author has formed a well-wrought urn that holds them all, that turns them into a Wagnerian elixir that that -- well, like TRISTAN -- is always eternal, and always modern, and crashes into you, hurling you through the air, if you let it, into your own extended love death --

"I was walking through the halls of the public library in Cleveland and I found a shelf with all these Roald Dahl books! And then I spotted ""Matilda."" I've been looking for ""Matilda"" because my mom had read it and she loved it! My mom is a good judge of books so I wanted to read it.

So I checked out the book and ran to the car so I could go to my grandma's house and read it. I had a bursting feeling in side of me. I felt ready to explode! When the car pulled into the driveway and parked, I burst out of the car and ran inside my grandma's house, flopped down on my favorite chair and started reading ""Matilda.""

The character Matilda is a genius girl with idiot parents who are always yelling and raging at her for no reason! With Matilda's magic powers she pays back her parents and has a fun time driving them crazy.

But things at school are different. The hated headmistress the Trunchbull is no match for Matilda and her magic powers. Miss Honey has a loving heart and trusts Matilda with her biggest secret.

This book is extremely funny and mysterious. After I finished this genius book, and my mom knew I loved it, she got me the movie! The movie is good, but not nearly as good as the book. You should see the movie and read the book! They're both wonderful.  -by Eliza (a student in msdu's class)",0

He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up.

They like carrying him around in their mouth too. I love that Mr. Beaver is refillable, and that you can clean him. These toys aren't huge, but since they are about the same size as some of the local real mice, it suits my kitties just fine!  Well worth buying;  good quality safe toy.",0

"The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!

Based on the sample I received, I cannot recommend this knife.",0

"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.
I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning does deserve an applaud for this story.",0
"I had loved Holes by Louis Sachar, so I made sure to read this by him too. It was a bit younger then I expected, but I also read Holes when I was younger too, so it makes sense that this would be for the same age. This is a short sweet book on bullying that addresses it through solving the mystery behind a deadly virus. Tamaya does not understand why Marshall is acting differently, which is explained to her when she sees how he is being treated by Chad. Overall I think this does a good job on showing how bullying affects everyone, not just the victim. I would recommend this as a good bullying book because it is about solving a mystery, not bullying, which would then attract different types of readers. This gets four stars, because it is good, just a little young for me.",0

"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",0

But these aren't you sparkling flower fairies. These are gun weilding, electric winged, magic world police. Sworn to keep their world secret safe from all human kind. Nor is this boy just a genius, but also is one the worlds most wanted crimnals, to humans and fairies alike. And he just cracked the code.

"Always looking for something new to read.  When I read the description on this and realized there were additional books by the author Parnell Hall, thought I would read The Baxter Trust to check out the writer's story line.

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably.",0

My son loves it.  It's easy to learn, it's easy to play, and it's easy to learn to play.  I would recommend it.  It's a very fun game.  I don't think it's going to last long at all.

"I've read all of James' books on the Beatles, so was interested to see what he had to say about the Bee Gees. And, I wasn't disappointed. Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music. One thing I like about all of James' books, including this one, is the interesting tidbits of history that he includes - not only about the music and the bands, but about the time period in which they became popular.",0

The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a dangerous and dangerous situation. While in a very dangerous situation, they both have issues to work on. The characters are well developed and the storyline is full of action. The author does a great job of bringing the characters together and making the situation interesting.

This book is about two young people who find their way into one another's lives and have to find out what is going on. The story is fast paced and the characters are well developed. There is a lot of action and mystery that is well-developed. There is also a lot of romance and some action. The story is well written and the characters are well developed.

"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.  I can't tell you anymore of the plot, but I can tell you that you should definitely SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It's well worth it.",0

It's once again an entertaining story about a small town in the middle of nowhere, and a pair of very smart people, both very wealthy, very smart. The story revolves around a family of three, and the main character, a very smart man named Nicholas.

Nicholas is a smart man, and he has a very big heart. He is so smart, but he is also very self-centered. He is constantly thinking about his own life, and he is not very happy with his life, either. He does not want to be a ""bad"" person, but he is constantly thinking about his own life, and he is constantly thinking about his own life.

Mark G.

"I've been using a Logitech Mouse for the last two years and it's still going strong.  The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.

Since Ive gotten this lock they have still tried to steal a bike I have. I could see where they tried to cut through the cable but they coldly get through.

"Had two issues on install (a Master Electrician was on the job and I am a professional engineer):
1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.
Once working the unit is a dream -- very, very quiet operation, good volume on the exhaust and quick warm-up using the heater.  Nite light is just right.  I would recommend this unit, but caution folks about the two items above for the install.",0

"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.",0
"I just finished this book after a student recommended it to me. He was so enthusiastic about it, I had to give it a try. Since I am an English teacher and have read nothing else by the author, I wasn't expecting ""great literature,"" but a satisfying, easy read along the lines of The Hunger Games (which I loved, but it's not literary genius or anything).  I say without hesitation that this book is a masterpiece that ranks right up there with Catcher in the Rye.  I was stunned at every turn in this book. There were so many opportunities for this author to take clich&eacute;d, easy roads, but he just never did.  The voices of the characters and the supporting characters were just brilliant. This book contains some of the best lines about life and death I've ever read while still maintaining the believable voice of a teenager.  I cannot say enough about how stunned I am about the brilliance of this author. I don't even want to read another book for a while! I know it would be disappointing!",0

There are some very good parts.  The first part is about the woman who saves the man from the wolves and becomes the first wolf to ever kill a human.  The second part is about the two wolves who are a part of the story and the man who is one of the wolves.  I loved that part.

I read this book in two days.  I have read every one of the other books that I have read.  I enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read wolf stories.  It is a good story with lots of great characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.

It inspires anyone to grasp the concept of ""entertaining"" through the beautiful coffeetable type photos and well described pages. It does not even attempt to dictate the reader that the only place possible to lavishly celebrate life is to live in Maine. It teaches us to embrace the beauty of what you have, where you live and add a bit more passion to it. I would definitely consider this as a perfect gift to guests during the holidays.",0

The filters themselves are great and do a good job of keeping the dust down in my home.  I have been using these for the last year sense switching from the fiberglass mat style.

"Word A Round consists of a set of pieces, which are either left or right handed.  The pieces are not very detailed, but they are designed to be easy to take apart and assemble.  A little smaller than the size of a regular round, but still a fun toy for the little ones.  They love the fact that they can be attached to the pieces so they can take turns.  This is not a big deal for us, because it is a very simple toy that we have to play with.  The pieces are made of solid wood, so the kids can play with it, but we like that it doesn't fall apart when put together.  We love the fact that it is made of a soft material, and not of plastic.  I would recommend it for a 3 year old, but it is not for a 4 year old.  We just enjoy the fun of this toy.  It is very durable.  It does not break easily, but it is very easy to clean.

The price is right, and I would buy this again.  My son was very excited to get this for Christmas.  He is 5 and loves playing with it.  He loves to play with it, and it is a little big for him to hold.  He is learning to hold it and push it, and it is very comfortable.  We will be buying more for him.

I recently ended up using the wide wooden handle for a cup of tea.  This is a great solution.  I am using it for the first time in a cup of tea.  I have been using it for a while and it is very easy to use.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the handle to hold the tea in.  I have had to use a different handle for the last 3 cups of tea since I have to buy new ones every couple months.  I will buy another one for my first coffee maker.  I will post a photo of this after I've used it.  I love it.  I just wish I had bought this one sooner.I bought these to make my sandwich sandwiches for my family.  They are so easy to clean.  I was going to buy more of them but",1
This was smaller than I expected. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the plastic part. Not sure if it was a problem with the screw driver or not.

"First of all. Its case looks so ugly and cheap that I must warn you i you want to use it in any professional setting or regularly. It looks like an elementary school pen case . Why is it yellow and blue? any aesthetics?

Secondly, while all the parts works fine, it lacks one crucial component for apple stuff repairs: A plastic pryer. The tweezer coming along with it is definitely the worst in its class and useless for prying anything. To have to triangular pryers makes no sense.

On the other hand, the exchangeable screws works find and oiled properly. For this price I would rather buy ifixit toolsets at least it looks better for an Apple product...",0

"I had this one for about six months now, I use it almost daily, and it's perfect! I have used it for tough stuff like coffee beans, and in boiling soup, works amazing every time! Easy and comfortable to use (Some of these blenders have two buttons you need to push simultaneously! beware of those. ), easy to clean and store, I hardly ever use my fancy food processor anymore! Who wants to get that heavy clumsy thing out of the top shelf? I had other immersion blenders before but never this powerful. The only thing I would warn you about is not to pay too much for it! It's always moving between 50 and 150!

Update: So today it died off. didn't even last a year! I went to the company website to see if I can get just the motor part and it seems they're not selling those anymore at all.",0

Just wish it came in a bit bigger.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.  I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure it will be better than the $200 item that I paid for it.  It works great and keeps the coffee hot for about 10 hours.  I haven't used it yet,",1

I ordered a size up just like one of the reviewers suggested.  Bad idea!  Stick to your size.  Large/xlarge size was so big that i felt like I'm wearing a clown pants.

"I like Amazon/Warrior Women stories a lot. There doesn't need to be much plot to them for me to devour them. Having said that, and the fact that it was awhile ago that I read this, I really enjoyed the story. I had read some reviews voicing concerns about events taking place in the book, but considering the time these events took place (alternate reality, as it were,) this didn't bother me. I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot. I will also say that even though this is a Book One in a trilogy, this book stands on its own nicely. In fact, I really have no desire to finished this trilogy. I previewed the other two books and they don't hook me like this first book did. Unlike other trilogies I've read, there is no cliffhanger, that I recall. Overall, a rather enjoyable, (albeit long,) story. I don't normally read nearly 600 page stories. Aside: I don't care one whit about this author's gender issues. misrepresentations or not. We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian. I do not read most books mainly for the sexy bits. I absolutely believe you can be straight and write good gay/lesbian dialog. Love and emotions are universal.",0

"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.
On the matter of typos: there are a lot, but no more than in an average advanced reader copy. I wish them gone, but I have noticed that the author is donating all the proceeds from the books to the Breast Cancer and Save The Children foundations and professional editors cost a lot.",0

"5-11-2013  Silver Marcasite Rose Ring
I searched and searched the Amazon.com for the perfect Rose Ring for me:  The Poet.  This definitely turned out to be the perfect Rose Ring for me.  I purchased it for $45.99.  I was a little afraid when I ordered this that the rose would sit up too high.  But is does not.  It is a very enjoyable ring to wear.  I purchased it in a 7  thinking that I would wear it on my middle finger.  But it ended up fitting my left index finger perfect and I love wearing it on that hand.  Here is my meditation for this ring:

The Poet's Silver Rose Ring of Marcasite
Oh, there are some tales of those days of old
During the rush west in search for gold.
There was a rebellion
Led by Nevada women
To wear not gold but marcasite:
Beauty in what was of plenty seemed right.
The Poet wears a silver rose ring of marcasite;
Supporting this Nevada cause so right!

And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

"I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full.

"I am a fan of Doreen Owens Malek, her dialogue is witty and she steadily builds the romantic tension between her leads. Her novel, A Marriage of Convenience, is an enjoyable read albeit this is an older novel and there is a sense of the characters being behind the times in many ways.

Sharon Phillips returns to her father's ranch in California after his death, she is not happy to be in the Golden state though because she must face her first love, Taylor Braddock. Sharon fell in love with Taylor when she was only eighteen when she visited her father for his wedding to Taylor's mother. Taylor broke her heart and she has not been in contact with him since.

Taylor is a Vietnam vet (yes, this is dated) and he has had major difficulties adjusting back into civilian life. He was a POW and he deals with his memories with alcohol and a bad temper. He is about ten years older than Sharon and he finds her sweet and innocent, way too innocent for the likes of him so he sends her on her way making her believe that she is way too young for his jaded tastes.

Ten years later the two are forced to confront their feelings because Sharon's dad has bequeathed the ranch to the both of them but they must marry to inherit. They decide to go through with a marriage with plans to annul it fairly quickly but Sharon realizes her feelings for Taylor have not gone away.

This novel deals with some big issues like post traumatic stress, loneliness and fear. Taylor is very complex and he is hurting. His transformation from an angry young man to a mature businessman is believable. Sharon is not as interesting as Taylor (how could she be, she's a run-of-the-mill lawyer in Philadelphia) but she is generous and it is her giving heart that makes such a difference in Taylor's life.",0

I still use solvents to clean the bore and barrel but the amount of carbon this stuff pulls off everything else makes it seem like it works well as a solvent as well. This is a very popular CLP overseas and has been around for a long time but I had never seen it in the local stores here so I am glad I picked it up.",0

"Now that we have fixed it, it is nice and just what we expected.  Had to do some troubleshooting and found that the LED bar that spins to make the flames flicker had fallen out of the motor which makes it spin.  My husband and I had to take the insert completely apart to put the bar back into the motor so that it would spin to create the flame effect.  For those who are not able to do this type of ""fixing"", it would have meant sending it back.  Glad we were able to repair it.",0

I am giving a 5 star for quality and durability.I love this helmet, it has a really nice reflective coating. I have had it a few months now and it is definitely working well. I would definitely recommend it.I love the color of this helmet. It's a nice bright color for those of us who are not concerned about our eyes. I also love that the color is made of metal and not plastic. I received this helmet on a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would definitely recommend this helmet to everyone.I love this holster. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my Glock 19, and it fits very well on the Glock 19. It is a bit on the stiff side, but it is not a problem. It's also made of a little plastic, and it's a little uncomfortable to use. I had to return it, because it wasn't comfortable.I've owned a few different brands of wrist protection, and this one is a great choice for anyone who wants to protect their wrist",1
"These were highly recommended and I think they sound quite good, at least for my purposes. I've used them 3 times but unfortunately, the earhooks have fallen apart every time. This is really a problem, since I got these to use while jogging. It doesn't help that the earhooks are still a bit too big for my ears. Ok, so my ears are small - but not freakishly so!

"I am not a movie reviewer.  You may like it and you may not.  Once I caught on to the plot, I enjoyed it.  Part of the plot has to do with Celtic (pagan) rituals vs Christianity.  This may bother the very devout Christians as it did the lead character.  On the other hand, this movie is very well thought of in England and according to one movie group, is considered the 6th best movie made in England.  It comes close to being as popular as Rocky Horror Picture Show and I can imagine people lining up at midnight to see this movie and well prepared to sing along.  After all, it is a musical horror movie with no blood.  Do you want to hear a young Christopher Lee sing?",0
"Very nice kitchen tool, Seems to be well made and functional.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The blades are not sharp enough to cut through the fabric. This is a problem for most kitchen tools.

The only thing I will say about this knife is that the blades are very sharp and very comfortable. I have not used it for slicing, but it is well worth the price.

"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!",0

The extras including the dvd and the coffee table book are all excellent. If your a Seinfeld fan and do not own this then you really are not a true fan.",0
"One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book.  At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.  That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down.  That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!

Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end.",0

"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!",0

I was immediately saddened and in disbelief. Especially because I was loving them sooo much but now it makes me wonder if these are the right earbuds for me if they pull apart so easily. There isn't any safety or strength connecting these together, just the solder that connects 3 tiny wires.

"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied.",0

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes.",0

"This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the ""New World"", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.

It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as ""slightly original"" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.

All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.

It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time.",0
"I admire the author for many reasons--one for revealing so much of herself--and then not so much for undertaking the PCT but for undertaking it without any idea of what she was doing--putting herself into serious pain--and depite the conditions not giving up!!

""Into the Wild"" by John Krakauer comes to mind when reading the book. Cheryl running from her past--running from emotional pain--into a world of extremes on the PCT--not knowing what she will find in front of her--much like the character in Into the wild--unlike McCandless..fortunately for Cheryl--her ending was a good one!!!

For those who may choose to follow the path--searching for something--seek out some advice at least on equipment!! I'll bet if you ask Cheryl today if she could have shaved 20 pound off her load what the difference might have made....and I'm sure if you were able to ask Christopher McCandless if he would rethink going into the wild without a map which showed that there was a way across the river only 1/2 mile from the bus where he died--he would be the first to advocate being better prepared.

""Wild"" is truly inspirational-and highly recommended!",0

"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

No, it's not.",0

We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell. Just don't let stains sit for over a day as they will most likely still come out but not without much longer soaking and/or scrubbing for stable mystery stains. Good luck.",0
"Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.

"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",0

"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.

After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.

One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.

At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.

I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.

Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.

USDA Organic. Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The photo collage was after 5 days of growth, when the kittens first tried it. The last photo was on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended.",0

"The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys
  Useful Function keys functionality

"Jason went from enlisted to national security, and then went into a period of financial crisis. The other two authors had a similar view. The basic idea of the book is that we are going to look at the circumstances in a particular situation. This is a very good idea, but it is not a good one. The book is very well written and well presented. I was quite surprised to see that Mr. N. M. DeMille, the author of the book, wrote about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the country. He went into detail about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the nation. I found that this book was a good read. It is not a perfect read, but it is a good read.

"I just got this.  It's nice.  Lots of cool pics. The pics in overall review is pretty accurate.  Pages seem good. About same thickness as Magic Garden. As pics on both sides of pages.  I can't tell about make leak thru yet.
My only complaint is a good chunk (3/4) of pics go thru the middle seam. So that's gonna be a problem getting at. As far as I can tell pages are not perforated either. I like the book tho so I'll make it work. The pics seem pretty original. Big pics that take up the whole page.
I plan on attacking the book with markers. Most of the pics will require fine line markers. Some pics have big areas but almost every pic had areas of small details as seen in main summary. A couple of pages are empty of the small details- some are blank for you to detail your own. Ex butterflies etc. Least that's what is says up in corner of page.
It also apparently is kind of a search and find book too, tiny objects to find within the pics....with answers in the back. So its interactive. Good for all ages.
So for the price. I'm a very happy camper and can't wait to get my new markers in the mail and get going.

This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs.

I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.,0

"I ordered this because I wanted something easier than the usual chicken carrot made from scratch cake that I usually make for the pup's birthday. It's definitely easy. Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke.

"Ok, I received this blade about a week ago and decided to replace the 60T stock blade on my Kapex for a large built in job.  This required me to cross cut a LOT of 3/4 and 1/4 oak plywood.

Almost no tear out/splintering on the ply and the cuts on the solid stock where beautiful.  This blade cuts as well as my $150 Tenyru.  Time will tell how well/long it stays sharp.  Will post more info in a few weeks.

UPDATE.....been using the blade for a couple of weeks.  Still sharp.  The thing that sets this blade apart, and all good blades, is the ability to cut small amounts from small mouldings and leave them laying on the table rather than sending them off like a missle.

"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

"This horror flick is a really good example of ""closed circle"" and ""enemy unknown"" horror. It steadily ratchets up the tension until you are gripping the arms of your chair, wondering what is going to happen next and to whom.

Personally, I could have done with a little more hint of what was going on - the rules sometimes seem a bit inconsistent; however, that wasn't enough to detract from the film, and it's a personal taste anyway.

"Isabel Allende managed to offend mystery fans with some comments she made during an NPR interview about this book.  I really didn't know about this until after I had started the book.  I'm a mystery lover myself but I didn't see any reason to get in a fuss about it. Any way I quite enjoyed this book.  The author did not commit any of the cardinal sins against the mystery form that I have run into in some recent novels.

A series of odd and mysterious deaths occurred in San Francisco. They come to the attention of Amanda Martin, a young gamer who plays with a series of young misfits and her grandfather, who raised her after her parents' divorce.  Her father is a homicide detective and her mother is a Barbie-esque healer.

As Amanda and her friends investigate her mother is emotionally involved with two very different men.

I liked Amanda and her coherts and really enjoyed the smooth writing.  In fact I hated to put the book down.  While I didn't think it was a five star read, I thought it was a good, solid four star effort.",0

"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two.",0

"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",0

"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's heart --and succeeding.

Margaret is firmly on the shelf at 30 when her brother inherits a Dukedom.  He decides to share his good fortune with his sister, offering a sizable dowry for her to finally snag a husband.  That money is just what Rhys needs.  But when he meets Margaret, he is taken with her quick wit and strong will... and he knows they would be a perfect fit.

Margaret wants a man to love her for more than the money her brother is offering.  And Rhys' financial problems are no secret, so it takes some time before she is assured of his affections.  But the sexual tension is good and when they finally come together, it's great.  There are a few foils for the couple along the way, but they're all external.  It's a short read... only a little over 100 pages... but a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  4 stars.",0

"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol.",0

I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.",0

"Apple is more expensive than this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one-year warranty was very good. The case is clear, and the cover is very sturdy. I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive. I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a case that will protect their car.Best portable speaker for the price.  The sound is good.  The only complaint I have is that the audio is lacking in clarity.  I was unable to get it to work with my Windows 10 PC.  I'll update my review after I get a chance.  I also like the way it's a little larger than I'd like.  I don't think I'll be needing it for much longer.I've owned a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.  The only thing that's been disappointing is",1
"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it! If you like British humor, if you liked Pegg's other two movies, then you'll likely enjoy this film, as well. Very well written, interesting characters, nice approach to the mixed-genre subjects.",0

"This movie wasn't really that good. The plot was just too predictable. There were too many horrible scenes. There was a scene where a girl and her dog fight, and it was pretty bad. The scene where the dog falls in love with a girl is really bad. There was no real love story. And then there was the scene where the girl's dog goes out to dinner with a girl. There was no romance or even a sex scene. There was a scene where a guy throws a man in the face. The scene where a guy breaks into the house, and then he's shot by the police is really bad. The scene where a guy's girlfriend is killed is really bad. I really liked this movie, but I don't like the way the story was told.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get a signal out of the router. The wifi signal is pretty poor and it takes a while to get it working.

"The movie is calm; no real highs or lows. The actors are going through a change in their lives and they do it in a run down hotel in India.  I find it funny the power movies have over us and the brainwashing that it tries to do.  In this movie they try to make you feel bad for homosexuals, make you feel unmarried sexual relationships are okay because of loneliness, and that marriages that are strained should just end.  They show the only married couple splitting and doing it as easy as ""turning left"".  Besides this lack of morality I did enjoy the movie.",0

"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports. Came with 2 5ft. Ethernet cables.  BTW, sound fading problem has disappeared, thanks to this great product!",0

"First let me say that I wish they'd allow us to rate half-star intervals here; I'd have given this another half-star, mostly due to the great lines given to Arye Gross. I never heard of the guy before, but he's hilarious  here in the role of unlikely hero (that also doesn't want to be hero). Reminds me just a little of the Ash character in ""Army of  Darkness"" or the Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little  China"". It's Arye Gross' performance that raises this film above  mediocrity. Without his character, the movie would be a plain-jane sci-fi  movie with nothing special about it. Except Maryam D'Abo, whose  sexiness could almost carry the whole thing by itself. Mind you, the  character she plays isn't a particularly sexy character, but her subtle  beauty shows through anyway, and between her and Gross, there is always  something worth watching going on. The supporting cast, Jeff Speakman,  etc. , perform quite well also, and the bad guys are convincingly  evil-looking. The production standards are strictly B-movie however. Special effects are okay but not great, and the settings are sort of  cliched. There are several close-up shots of an asteroid that is pretty  obviously a miniature, but it adds a little charm to it that way--kind of  like watching an old sci-fi movie from the 50's. But understand that I  don't think this movie is trying to be anything but a B-movie. All in  all a standard sci-fi movie with great humor sprinkled throughout. I  laughed out loud many times while watching it. It's worth spending money  on, but just don't expect Oscar-winning stuff here. And now I have to go  see what other movies Arye Gross has been in.

"As the author mentions, not everyone is going to agree with everyone on his list. You read about people from the ACLU that provide attornies for NAMBLA, an orgranization that promotes man-boy sexual relationships. You read about people from PETA that say they want to have their skin made into boots and purses when they die because that is how we treat animals. You read about Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky, who just flat out hate the way America is and praise socialism. You read about the head of the NAACP who keeps telling blacks they are victims. I don't agree with everyone on the list, but it is interesting reading. There are a few conservatives on the list too. Michael Savage is on the list and deserves to be. He is one of the most crude and vile humans alive. I really wouldn't call Savage a conservative though, that is just what liberals call him.",0
We all have preferences and some will be the best. I will admit that I have been tempted to give this book a try but I think that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.

It will probably not last as long as the one I replaced. I have not used it yet, but I have no doubt that it will last for years. I have a spare key, but it is so much more expensive than the one I replaced. I am hoping that I will have it to replace the old one for years to come. I have had no problems with this one. It is very sturdy and sturdy. I will be buying more. I was very excited to finally have this tool in my tool box. I have a number of other tools and this is the one. I have always wanted to own a tool box that could be used for cutting wire, etc. However, I was very disappointed with this tool. It was not very sharp and was not very sharp.

"Two weeks ago I adopted a kitten and she was a puppy. She was a small baby and we had two small dogs. I thought she would get the treat, but it was too small. She had no interest in chewing on it. I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

"As appealing as the ""guitarcentric"" cover might be, this book by Alan Paul not only relates a magical musical experience, but also recounts everyday events experienced by an expatriate in this gargantuan land. The character of the Chinese people and their complex culture comes through well in this part travel book and part musical memoir. It makes for a fascinating read and would most appeal to those who have picked up a guitar and, at some time, dreamed of being on stage. (Of course that includes all of us who have picked up a guitar.",0
This book was obviously thrown together. Not the authors caliber of writing. I have read her other books which were actually pretty good. There was not chemistry between the characters.

"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

The story is told from both POV's. Im really happy that the writer Anna Campbell gave this story an epilogue! It gave this story that something more.",0

"I purchased this Griddle to replace a Teflon Grill Teflon that I had been using for a year.  The grill is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this grill to heat up the Keurig, and it worked great.  I used it for the first time to cook with a single scoop of nonstick chicken broth, and the nonstick chicken made a very flavorful, flavorful chicken broth.  The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.  I like that the nonstick chicken broth is thicker and easier to clean, as well as that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean and clean with the other nonstick chicken.

This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.

"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Overall, I liked this book very much, and I'm not sure that I'll be reading any",1

It was not written in Grisham's usual style, so he's either losing his touch, trying something new, or not paying attention.

"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series.",0

"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

"I felt the military was covered well. Occasionally the group fleeing the monster encounter military personal fighting the beast and in their utterances we get an update on what's really going on, the big picture. It was probably unrealistic though, or at least some parts of it were unrealistic. 6 hours after Godzilla drops, M1 tanks (our main battle tank) and even heavier artillery pieces are fighting in Manhattan? Didn't earlier in the movie it show one of the bridges into Manhattan being destroyed? Perhaps it was possible. . .

It was only after the movie was over, thinking about it, that I realized what the movie was about (odd that I give a movie I don't understand 10 stars, but I do - I think my date liked it as much or more than I did). I think Cloverfield is about the bravery of the characters. Each character in the movie is braver than I would have been but it is believable.",0
Very cute and good quality fabric. Zippers worked well too.,0
"I like this because it is small and ergonomically well designed.  I am keeping it.  However, there are many tradeoffs and issues that anyone should note:

1.  The movie function is better in quality than stills for almost all conditions.

2.  The movie function sound picks up faint noise from absolutely everything the camera does, from zoom to auto adjust the focus.  This can only be heard under quiet conditions, but it is there, and in fact mentioned in the manual.

3.  The low light still is very poor, except if it is pitch dark and you set it for that condition.  I find taking pictures indoors without the flash superior than with it on.

4.  The camera is very sensitive to shakes during still...and the image stabalizer only works for movies.  This really needs a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruins the image, particularly in zoom.

5.  It is true you can take a still while recording a movie.  However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sounds of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio

I love the camera for convenience and remarkable capability.

From other reviews, the new HD version solves none of the issues I mention.

Well-taken stills with the Epson Picturemate printer are excellent.

Just be patient and have a very very steady hand.",0
"Good product. Right out the box it was an awesome sound.

"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag.",0
"A mediocre movie.  The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together.  I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.

"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up.",0

"WOWSER

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways.",0

"Home Depot added a store brand line of lower-cost LED bulbs and put their Feit bulbs on the clearance rack. I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.

Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.

I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice.",0

This would have been terrific as a 1 hour Key & Peele comedy special, but it doesn't quite work as a feature film.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitten that played Keanu was absolutely adorable!! That cat was the true star of this movie. And it's precious that Keanu Reeves was the voice of the cat in one scene of the movie.

"What could have been a really powerful story about a strong female character was completely spoiled by an unnecessary amount of pornographic sex. Former Capt. Kacey O'Donnell, Marine combat helicopter pilot, recently home from Afghanistan is visited by the love of her life, retired Navy SEAL, Nathan Weatherly. Nathan has come to the sleepy New Hampshire town when his former BFF lets him know that Kacey is in need of an intervention. Throw in a really great plot line about a kidnapped pre-teen who is also in need of help and the action gets good. So... if you can speed read through the smut, you may have a good read.",0

"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

A nice collection with some great authors, perfect to pass some time.

"One of the problems associated with being a popular genre author, is that after awhile, the books just a seem to blend together. I've read everything Grisham has written, and really the only one that sticks out was the Pelican Brief, and The Firm. Gray Mountain has the same mix of ingredients as previous novels. Lawyer with some sort of issue. Injured party needing a lawyer. Some big nasty law firm. Some big nasty corporation. Mix together. Publish.  Not saying Gray Mountain is bad. It is a decent read, but it just seems to be so predictable that you never really loose yourself in the novel.",0

"Very disappointed in this vx-981K. I had hoped to be able to do a 4k photo burst capture-the menus in the unit are difficult to navigate and understand. The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps.",0

"Until Brueggeman's Old Testament Theology was published in 1997, this was  the largest dose one could find in one place. The articles in this  collection were all previously published in journals and other collections,  but tracking them all down would be a difficult task. Therefore, the  volume is very worthwhile. Even in the light of his most recent  publications it is still a useful collection for a couple of other reasons. First, these articles were produced over a period of a couple of decades,  so the attentive reader can observe Brueggeman's biblical theology as it  developed over his career. Second, many of the articles are sustained  treatments of individual texts, the likes of which do not appear in his  recent Old Testament Theology. Most importantly, these essays reveal the  increasing impact of contemporary literary studies on Old Testament  Theology. For all of these reasons this collection is a treasure and may  be considered a prerequisite for reading Brueggeman's ""Old Testament  Theology:  Testimony, Advocacy, and Dispute.",0

"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general.",0

"STORY: Glenn Ford stars as the rancher Smith, who is driving his family to frustration with his gentle procrastinating ways that have kept the farm from doing well. The hay needs to be cut, and he is distracted with his ongoing friendships with a local Nez Perce Native American tribe. When a tribal member is wrongly accused of murder, Smith comes to his defense. As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it. Even a good review in the LA Times did not help bring the viewers in and it was out of theaters before the word of mouth could send in the crowds. I recommend this hidden little film from the Disney vault.",0

"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop.",0

"I have no idea why I'm asked this stuff about books and tv shows. if I didn't want them or want to see them, I'd not requested them, right? I'd never seen F&B when it was on tv, but now I can catch up.. that, the guardian.. on and on .. all of downton abbey.. I love these shows and wouldn't request them if I didnt' want to see them, right?",0
This book was excruciatingly boring.  The characters were just boring.  There were too many irrelevant details.  The plot was poorly written.  The characters were just predictable.  The story was a little predictable.  The ending was a little predictable.  The story was boring.  I felt like I was reading the book in a very long time.  I wish I could have read the book again.  I can't tell you how many times I feel like I'm reading it.  I don't know.  I felt like I,1

"We use this with our toddler as a ""learning tower."" It is the perfect height for her to stand on and reach the kitchen counter. She is 2.5, so she have the motor ability and skill level to stay up on this step stool and help when we cook or do things in the kitchen. I also use this around the house as a regular step stool. We have a small kitchen, so I like that I can fold this and keep it out of the way. A large wooden learning tower would not work well for our space at all. This definitely wouldn't work with a younger baby as a learning tower. Use your judgment. You know your child and their ability to stand on a stool without falling.. if you decide to use this as a learning tower too.",0
"After about 2 months of use, the quality has improved.

I recommended this book to my friends.  I really enjoyed the book.  I will be looking for more of this authors books in the Protectors Novels.,0
"Great for emergency use to help with the odor.  I will keep this for the next couple of months.My dogs love this food.  My dog eats it in a very large bowl.  I mix it in with a fresh batch of kibble and he has been able to eat it a lot without a problem.  I would recommend this food to anyone who wants to give your dogs a treat.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick snack.I got this for my 17 lb lab puppy.  He's a senior puppy, so I wanted a harness that would help him.  This was perfect.  It's great quality, and the stitching is soft and soft and well made.  I can't say enough about this harness!  It's a great quality product, and it fits my puppy perfectly.  I will definitely purchase this again.My dog is a big che",1
I works fairly well but it has some issues. I will update my review if I find a way to fix the issue.,1
"This is the first Furby we've had in our house. I was determined not to get caught up in the melee of getting one. But I stumbled across on at Costco at a great price so I picked it up for my 9 year-old daughter for Christmas. We have had a lot of fun with it even though it can get pretty obnoxious at times! It is funny how it progresses and it can change personality. But if you are aware of that feature, it makes it okay, especially if you know how to control the personalities.

This one is a nice set of blues and the amount of animation and movement is impressive for robotic toy in the price range that I paid ($30). So we will have fun with it and since it 'evolves' it will hopefully last longer than some other toys that disappear in a week.

As an adult, I'm fascinated to wake it up at times and see what it says. As long as I know how to turn it off when I'm tired of hearing the barrage of speech... then we are all good. My daughter has had fun as well.",0
Darling toy that my son plays with and the wooden trains are a nice touch. I would recommend.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the carpet. It is very thin and doesn't stay on for long. I would recommend this to anyone who has a kid who wants to play with,1

"I have seen WOMAN OF THE NIGHT and the other two films in the series, I was pretty impressed with this movie. The movie is a bit cheesy, but the acting is okay and the story is well told. The acting is a bit predictable. This movie is still fun to watch.I love this series! I will watch them again and again!I love this series! I will watch them again and again!I really enjoyed the movie, but it was hard to follow.  I thought the ending was a little bit too long.  But I liked it.  This movie is a movie that takes a good look at some of the things that went wrong.  I was bored and disappointed.  I really enjoyed the movie.  I can watch it again and again and watch it again",1

"This is the sixth Dave Weigel book I've read.  I enjoyed it the most and am looking forward to the next one.  I have to say, this is definitely not the best book I've read in a long time.  If you like Dave Weigel's writing style and a fast paced story, you will love this one.  If you like how he writes, you will love this book.I was not disappointed.  I have a hard time putting down.  I had trouble keeping up with the story, but I am not sure how I feel about this book.  I am a sucker for suspense and it kept me interested.  It is a fun story and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.  I can't wait to see what happens next.I have read many",1

"I had really high hopes for this, as it is a very nice set for the price. The other two I had were the most expensive and the other was the most expensive.I bought this for my little one.  She loves it.  My daughter is still very young and still plays with it as a hobby.  I'm very happy with it.  It has great detail and my daughter will love it.  I'm sure she will like it even more as she grows.I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this.  He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood.  It does a good job of holding up to the wind and I think it will be a great addition to our home.  I plan on getting another one.  We are not sure what the future holds for us but I will update this review.My daughter loves this puzzle. She has been playing with it all day.

This float is big...in a good way. It's very sturdy and holds my 4 1/2 month old son very well. He likes the toys that are included but I stick the foam ones on the side of the shower wall during his bath to help entertain him. They also help me to teach him a few primary colors. The canopy is adjustable and keeps the sun off of him nicely. Well worth the money.,0
"I enjoyed this book.  The author has a strong voice, but the book was much less overtly personalized than the editorial reviews led me to expect, for which I was grateful. In all other respects, I thought the editorial reviews are pretty good summaries of what you will find in this book.

It could have been better edited.  Despite its chronological organization, there are a surprising number of places where a person or event who has died earlier in the book pops up again. For instance, after the chapter on  Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one moves to a chapter that begins with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again.  Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily.  The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits references too often.

Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, as one would expect from an art critic.  But there are only two sets of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the images and sights described by the author.  I often wanted to be able to compare his descriptions to photographs of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the covers of the book. I don't know if the ebook is different but the experience of reading would really be enhanced if there were more photos located closely to what is being described or at least hyperlinks to an image on the web with what is being described.

I would give the text, standing alone, 5 stars but the overall work, for the reasons just stated, I grade at 4 stars.",0

"This story centers around Becca, an empty nested looking to shake up her boribgvworld. She finally seems to meet an exciting man in John. He shows her a world of extreme elegance with indulgence all around. Becca Noires way with words will wrap around you and pull you so into her storyline so you feel like the voyeur John (our leading man) is. The erotism is magnificent. I was on the edge of my chair from start to finish of this book. I am voluntarily leaving this review for an ARC I received.",0
